<p>The translations in this volume are chiefly my own; but I have
also taken expressions and sentences freely from others&mdash;and
especially from Dr M&rsquo;Crie, in his translation of the
&lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo;&mdash;when they seemed to convey
well the sense of the original.&nbsp; It would be impossible to
distinguish in all cases between what is my own and what I have
borrowed.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo; have been
translated at least four times into English.&nbsp; The
translation of Dr M&rsquo;Crie, published in 1846, is the most
spirited.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; were translated
by the Rev. Edward Craig, A.M. Oxon., in 1825, following the
French edition of 1819, which again followed that of Bossut in
1779.&nbsp; A new translation, both of the &lsquo;Letters&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; by George Pearce,
Esq.&mdash;the latter after the restored text of M.

1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>There are few names which have become more classical in modern
literature than that of Blaise Pascal.&nbsp; There is hardly any
name more famous at once in literature, science, and
religion.&nbsp; Cut off at the early age of thirty-nine&mdash;the
fatal age of genius&mdash;he had long before attained pre-eminent
distinction as a geometer and discoverer in physical science;
while the rumour of his genius as the author of the
&lsquo;Provincial Letters,&rsquo; and as one of the chiefs of a
notable school of religious thought, had spread far and
wide.&nbsp; His writings continue to be studied for the
perfection of their style and the vitality of their
substance.&nbsp; As a writer, he belongs to no school, and is
admired simply for his greatness by Encyclopedist and
Romanticist, by Catholic and Protestant alike,&mdash;by men like
Voltaire and Condorcet and Sainte-Beuve, no less than by men like
Bossuet, Vinet, and Neander.&nbsp; His
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; have been carefully restored, and
re-edited with minute and loving faithfulness in our time by
editors of such opposite tastes and tendencies as M. Prosper
Faug&egrave;re, M. Havet, and M. Victor Rochet.&nbsp; <!-- page
2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Cousin
considered it one of the glories of his long intellectual career
that he had first led the way to the remarkable restoration of
Pascal&rsquo;s remains.&nbsp; Of all the illustrious names which
group themselves around Port Royal, it is Pascal alone, and
Racine&mdash;who was more its pupil, but less its
representative&mdash;whose genius can be said to survive, and to
invest it with an undying lustre.</p>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s early death, the reserve of his friends under
the assaults which the &lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo; provoked,
and his very fame, as a writer, have served in some degree to
obscure his personality.&nbsp; To many a modern reader he is
little else than a great name.&nbsp; The man is hidden away
behind the author of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; or the
defender of Port Royal.&nbsp; Some might even say that his
writings are now more admired than studied.&nbsp; They have been
so long the subject of eulogy that their classical character is
taken for granted, and the reader of the present day is content
to look at them from a respectful distance rather than
spontaneously study them for himself.&nbsp; There may be some
truth in this view.&nbsp; Pascal is certainly, like many other
great writers, far more widely known than he is understood or
appreciated.&nbsp; The old, which are still the common, editions
of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; have also given a certain
commonplace to his reputation.&nbsp; It were certainly a worthy
task to set him more clearly before our age both as a man and as
a writer.</p>
<p>It is no easy task, however, to do this; and to tell the full
story of Pascal&rsquo;s life is no longer possible.&nbsp; Its
records, numerous as they are, are incomplete; all fail more or
less at an interesting point of his career.&nbsp; They leave much
unexplained; and the most familiar confidences of his sisters and
niece, who have preserved <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>many interesting details regarding
him, have not entirely removed the veil from certain aspects of
his character.&nbsp; The well-known life by Madame P&eacute;rier,
his elder sister, is of course the chief authentic source of his
biography.&nbsp; It was written shortly after his death, although
not published for some time later; and nothing can be more
lively, graphic, and yet dignified, than its portraiture of his
youthful precocity, and, again, of the devotions and austerities
of his later years.&nbsp; But it leaves many gaps
unsupplied.&nbsp; Like other memoirs of the kind, it is written
from a somewhat conventional point of view.&nbsp; No one, as M.
Havet says, was nearer to him in all senses of the expression, or
could have given a more true and complete account of all the
incidents in his life; but she was not only his sister, but his
enthusiastic friend and admirer, in whose eyes he was at once a
genius and a saint&mdash;a man of God, called to a great
mission.&nbsp; It was from a consciousness of this mission, and
the full glory of his religious fame, that she looked back upon
all his life; and the lines in which she draws it are coloured,
in consequence, too gravely and monotonously.&nbsp; Certain
particulars she drops out of sight altogether.&nbsp; These are to
be found scattered here and there, sometimes in his own letters,
more frequently in the letters of his younger sister, Jacqueline,
and in a supplementary memoir, written by his niece, Marguerite
P&eacute;rier, all of which have been carefully published in our
time, and made accessible to any reader. <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a>&nbsp; The researches of M. Cousin, M.
Faug&egrave;re, and M. Havet, the <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>curious and
interesting monograph of M. L&eacute;lut, <a
name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a> have thrown light on various points;
while the copious portraiture of Sainte-Beuve <a
name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a> has given to the whole an animation and
a desultory charm which no English pen need strive to
imitate.</p>
<p>My only hope, as my aim, will be in this little volume to set
before the English reader perhaps a more full and connected
account of the life and writings of Pascal than has yet appeared
in our language, freely availing myself of all the sources I have
indicated.&nbsp; And if long and loving familiarity with a
subject&mdash;an intimacy often renewed both with the
&lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo;&mdash;form any qualification for
such a task, I may be allowed to possess it.&nbsp; It is now
nearly thirty years since the study of Neander first drew me to
the study of Pascal; and I ventured, with the confidence of
youth, to draw from the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; which had
then recently appeared in the new and admirable edition of M.
Faug&egrave;re, the outlines of a Christian Philosophy. <a
name="citation4c"></a><a href="#footnote4c"
class="citation">[4c]</a>&nbsp; I shall venture on no such
ambition within the bounds of this volume; but I trust I may be
able to bring together the story of Pascal&rsquo;s life,
controversy, and thought in such a manner as to lead others to
the study of a writer truly great in the imperishable grandeur
and elevation of his ideas, no less than in the exquisite finish
and graces of his style.</p>
<h2><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>CHAPTER I.<br />
PASCAL&rsquo;S FAMILY AND YOUTH.</h2>
<p>Blaise Pascal was born at Clermont-Ferrand on the 19th June
1623.&nbsp; He belonged to an old Auvergne family, Louis XI.
having ennobled one of its members for administrative services as
early as 1478, although no use was made of the title, at least in
the seventeenth century.&nbsp; The family cherished with more
pride its ancient connection with the legal or
&lsquo;Parliamentary&rsquo; institutions of their country. <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; Pascal&rsquo;s grandfather, Martin
Pascal, was treasurer of France; and his father, &Eacute;tienne,
after completing his legal studies in Paris, acquired the
position of Second President of the Court of Aides at
Clermont.&nbsp; In the year 1618 he married Antoinette Begon, who
became the mother of four children, of whom three survived and
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>became distinguished.&nbsp; Madame Pascal died in 1626 or
1628; <a name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a> and two years afterwards (in 1630)
&Eacute;tienne Pascal abandoned his professional duties, and came
to Paris, in order that he might devote himself to the education
of his children.</p>
<p>Soon after the Pascal family settled in Paris, their character
and endowments seem to have attracted a widespread
interest.&nbsp; If not superior to the Arnaulds, they were no
less remarkable.&nbsp; They did not escape the penetrating eye of
Richelieu, who, as he looked upon the father with his son, then
fifteen years of age, and his two daughters, was so struck by
their beauty that he exclaimed, without waiting for their formal
introduction to him, that he <i>would like to make something
great of them</i>. <a name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>&nbsp; &Eacute;tienne Pascal was a man
not only of official capacity, but of keen intellectual instincts
and aspirations.&nbsp; He shared eagerly in the scientific
enthusiasm of his time.&nbsp; A letter by him addressed to the
Jesuit No&euml;l shows that the vein of satire, half pleasant,
half severe, which reached such perfection in the famous
&lsquo;Letters&rsquo; of his son, was not unknown to the
father.&nbsp; The careful and systematic education which he gave
to his son would alone have stamped him as a man of remarkable
intelligence.</p>
<p>Gilberte, Pascal&rsquo;s elder sister and biographer, exerted
an influence upon his character only second to that of his
father.&nbsp; She married her cousin, M. P&eacute;rier, also of a
Parliamentary family, and Counsellor of the Court of Aides at
Clermont.&nbsp; She was alike beautiful and <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>accomplished, a
student of mathematics, philosophy, and history. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; For a time she shared in the
enjoyments of the world, like other persons of her age and
condition; but the same impulses of religious enthusiasm which
animated the rest of her family led to her practical abandonment
of the world while still young.&nbsp; The memoirs which she
composed, both of her brother and sister, and her letters, all
indicate a high intelligence and a mingled dignity, sweetness,
and restraint of character, which made her their best counsellor
and friend.</p>
<p>The younger sister, Jacqueline, has been made a special study
by M. Cousin amongst the &lsquo;Illustrious Women of the
Seventeenth Century.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was beautiful as her
sister, and a child of genius like her brother.&nbsp; She began
to compose verses at the age of eight, and in her eleventh year
assisted in the composition and the acting of a comedy in five
acts, which was a subject of universal talk in Paris.&nbsp; Her
powers, both as an actor and a verse-maker, made a wonderful
reputation at the time, which, as we shall see, was highly
serviceable to her after.&nbsp; Her verses, it must be confessed,
are somewhat artificial and hollow; but her letters, and, more
remarkable than either her verses or her letters, her
&lsquo;Thoughts&rsquo; on the &lsquo;Mystery of the Death of
Christ,&rsquo; are in some respects very fine, and might even
claim a place beside some of those of her brother.&nbsp; They are
equally elevated in tone, and pervaded by the same subtle,
penetrating, radiant mysticism, the same rapture of
self-sacrificing aspiration, <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>though lacking
the glow of inward fire and exquisite charm of style which marked
the author of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Noble-minded and full of genius, she was yet without his depth
and power of feeling, or his skill and finish as an author.&nbsp;
In 1646 she came, along with her brother, and greatly through his
influence, strongly under the power of religion; and in 1652,
after her father&rsquo;s death, she renounced the world, and
became one of the Sisters of Port Royal.&nbsp; She died amidst
the persecution of the Sisters in 1661, a year before her
brother.</p>
<p>In Paris the elder Pascal became a centre of men of congenial
intellectual tastes with himself, and his house a sort of
rendezvous for the mathematicians and the physicists of the
time.&nbsp; Among them were Descartes, Gassendi, Mersenne,
Roberval, Carcavi, and Le Pailleur; and from the frequent reunion
of these men is said to have sprung the Academy of Sciences
founded in 1666.&nbsp; It is interesting to notice that it was
into this same society that Hobbes was introduced on his first
and second visits to France, when he accompanied the future Duke
of Devonshire there as tutor.&nbsp; With Father Mersenne and
Gassendi especially he formed a warm friendship, which sheds an
interest over his life.&nbsp; Possibly in some of these reunions
the author of the &lsquo;Leviathan&rsquo; may have encountered
the young Pascal, and joined in the half admiration and half
incredulity which his wonderful powers had begun to excite.</p>
<p>There never certainly was a more singular story of youthful
precocity than that which Madame P&eacute;rier has given of her
brother, accustomed as we have become to such stories in the
lives of eminent men.&nbsp; Detecting the remarkable powers of
the boy, his father had formed <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>very definite
resolutions as to his education.&nbsp; His chief maxim, Madame
P&eacute;rier says, was always &ldquo;to keep the boy above his
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; And for this reason he did not wish him to
learn Latin till he was twelve years of age, when he might easily
acquire it.&nbsp; In the meantime, he sought to give him a
general idea of grammar&mdash;of its rules, and the exceptions to
which these rules are liable&mdash;and so to fit him to take up
the study of any language with intelligence and facility.&nbsp;
He endeavoured further to direct his son&rsquo;s attention to the
more marked phenomena of nature, and such explanations as he
could give of them.&nbsp; But here the son&rsquo;s perception
outstripped the father&rsquo;s power of explanation.&nbsp; He
wished &ldquo;to know the reason of everything;&rdquo; and when
his father&rsquo;s statements did not appear to him to give the
reason, he was far from satisfied.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For he had always an admirable perspicacity
in discerning what was false; and it may be said that in
everything and always truth was the sole object of his
mind.&nbsp; From his childhood he could only yield to what seemed
to him evidently true; and when others spoke of good reasons, he
tried to find them for himself.&nbsp; He never quitted a subject
until he had found some explanation which satisfied
him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once, among other occasions, he was so interested in the fact
that the sound emitted by a plate lying on a table when struck,
suddenly ceased on the plate being touched by the hand, that he
made an inquiry into sound in general, and drew so many
conclusions that he embodied them in a
&ldquo;well-reasoned&rdquo; treatise.&nbsp; At this time he was
only twelve years of age.</p>
<p>At the same age he gave still more astonishing evidence of his
precocious scientific capacities.&nbsp; His father, <!-- page
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>perceiving his strong scientific bent, and desirous that
he should first of all acquaint himself with languages before the
absorption of the severer, but more engrossing, study seized him,
had withdrawn from his sight all mathematical books, and
carefully avoided the subject in the presence of his son when his
friends were present.&nbsp; This, as might be expected, only
quickened the curiosity of the boy, who frequently begged his
father to teach him mathematics, and the father promised to do so
as a reward when he knew Latin and Greek, which he was then
learning.&nbsp; Piqued by this resistance, the boy asked one day,
&ldquo;What mathematical science was, and of what it
treated?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was told that its aim was to make
figures correctly, and to find their right relations or
proportions to one another.&nbsp; He began, says his sister, to
meditate during his play-hours on the information thus
communicated to him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And being alone in a room where he was
accustomed to amuse himself, he took a piece of charcoal and drew
figures upon the boards, trying, for example, to make a circle
perfectly round, a triangle of which the sides and angles were
equal, and similar figures.&nbsp; He succeeded in his task, and
then endeavoured to determine the proportion of the figures,
although so careful had his father been in hiding from him all
knowledge of the kind, that he did not even know the names of the
figures.&nbsp; He made names for himself, then definitions, then
axioms, and finally demonstrations; and in this way had pushed
his researches as far as the thirty-second proposition of the
first book of Euclid.&rdquo; <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point a &lsquo;surprise&rsquo; visit of his father
arrested him in his task, although so absorbed was he in it, that
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>he did not at first recognise his father&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; The older Pascal, having satisfied himself of the
astonishing achievement which the youthful mathematician had
worked out for himself in solitude, ran with tears of joy to
communicate the fact to his friend M. le Pailleur.&nbsp; It was
agreed betwixt them that such an aptitude for science should no
longer be balked, and the lad was furnished with the means of
pursuing his mathematical studies.&nbsp; Before he had completed
his sixteenth year he had written the famous treatise on Conic
Sections which excited the &ldquo;mingled incredulity and
astonishment&rdquo; of Descartes. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>The happiness of Pascal&rsquo;s home was suddenly interrupted
by an unforeseen calamity.&nbsp; On coming to Paris, his father
had invested his savings in bonds upon the Hotel de Ville.&nbsp;
The Government, impoverished by wars and extravagance, reduced
the value of these revenues, with the result of creating
discontent and calling forth expostulation from the disappointed
annuitants.&nbsp; Some of them met together, and, among others,
&Eacute;tienne Pascal, and gave such vent to their feelings as to
alarm the Government.&nbsp; Richelieu took summary means of
asserting his authority and silencing the disturbers.&nbsp; The
meeting was denounced as seditious, and a warrant issued to
arrest the offenders and throw them into the Bastille.&nbsp;
&Eacute;tienne Pascal, having become apprised of the hostile
designs of the Cardinal, contrived to conceal himself at first in
Paris, and afterwards took refuge in the solitude of his native
district.&nbsp; His children were left without his care, and
plunged in the greatest sorrow.&nbsp; At intervals, indeed, he
contrived to see them in secret, <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and is said
even to have nursed Jacqueline through a severe attack of the
smallpox, which impaired her hitherto remarkable beauty.&nbsp;
But all the pleasant companionship which he had enjoyed as their
instructor, and the centre of a group of intellectual friends,
was at an end.&nbsp; He could only visit his home by stealth.</p>
<p>At this crisis (February 1639) Richelieu took a fancy to have
Scud&eacute;ry&rsquo;s tragi-comedy of &ldquo;L&rsquo;Amour
Tyrannique&rdquo; acted before him by young girls.&nbsp; The
Court lady who undertook the management of the piece appealed to
Jacqueline Pascal, whose accomplishments as a girl-actor were
well known, to assist in its performance.&nbsp; She was then
thirteen years of age.&nbsp; The elder sister, who, in the
enforced absence of the father, was acting as the head of the
family, replied, with feeling, that &ldquo;they did not owe any
favour to M. le Cardinal, who had not acted kindly towards
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The request, however, was pressed, in the hope
that some good might come out of the affair to the family, and
Jacqueline was allowed to appear.&nbsp; The result was all that
could be anticipated.&nbsp; The Cardinal, charmed by the grace
and accomplishment of her acting, received her cordially when she
ventured to approach him with a petition on behalf of her father,
thrown into a form of verses similar to many which she had
already composed.&nbsp; The verses have been preserved with her
other pieces, and have been thus rendered:&mdash;<a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>&ldquo;O marvel not, Armand, the
great, the wise,<br />
If I have failed to please thine ear, thine eyes;<br />
My sorrowing spirit, torn by countless fears,<br />
Each sound forbiddeth save the voice of tears.<br />
With power to please thee wouldst thou me inspire?&mdash;<br />
Recall from exile now my hapless sire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She has herself described, in an interesting letter to her
father, <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a> the whole incident, and the result of
her intercession.&nbsp; Having told how the Cardinal had been
previously well prepared, and had the true state of the case
explained in reference to her father, who appears to have been in
no degree to blame in the agitation which called forth the
displeasure of the Government, she says that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;M. le Cardinal appeared to take great
pleasure in the representation, especially when I spoke.&nbsp; He
laughed very much, as did the whole company.&nbsp; When the
comedy was finished, I descended from the theatre with the design
of speaking to Madame d&rsquo;Aiguillon [the same lady who had
already interested herself in the business].&nbsp; But as the
Cardinal seemed about to leave, I approached him directly, and
recited to him the verses I send you.&nbsp; He received them with
extraordinary affection and caresses more than you can imagine;
for at first, when I approached, he cried, &lsquo;Voil&agrave; la
petite Pascal!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he embraced me and kissed me,
and while I said my verses he continued to hold me in his arms,
and kissed me each moment with great satisfaction.&nbsp; And then
when I was done he said, &lsquo;Yes; I grant to you all that you
ask; write to your father that he may return with
safety.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon Madame d&rsquo;Aiguillon
approached, and addressed the Cardinal.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is truly
well, sir, that you do something for this man.&nbsp; I have heard
him spoken of as a thoroughly honest and learned man, and it is a
pity he should remain unemployed.&nbsp; Then he has a son who is
very learned in <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>mathematics, although as yet only
fifteen years of age.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cardinal assured me once
more that I might tell you to return in all safety; and as he
seemed in such good humour, I asked him further that you might be
allowed yourself to pay your thanks and respects to his
Eminence.&nbsp; He said you would be welcome; and then, with
other discourse, repeated, &lsquo;Tell your father, when he
returns, to come and see me.&rsquo;&nbsp; This he said three or
four times.&nbsp; After this, as Madame d&rsquo;Aiguillon was
going away, my sister went forward to salute her.&nbsp; She
received her with many caresses, and inquired for our brother,
whom she said she wished to see.&nbsp; It was this that led to
his introduction to the Duchess, who paid him many compliments on
his scientific attainments.&nbsp; We were then conducted to a
room, where we had a magnificent collation of dried sweetmeats,
fruits, lemonade, and such things.&nbsp; Here the Duchess renewed
her caresses in a manner you will hardly believe.&nbsp; In short,
I cannot tell how much honour I received, for I am obliged to
write as succinctly as possible.&nbsp; I am greatly obliged to M.
de Moudroy for all the trouble he has taken, and I beg you will
be so good as write to him by the first post to thank him, for he
well deserves it.&nbsp; As for me, I esteem myself extremely
happy to have in any way assisted in a result which must give you
satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter was written from Paris on the 4th April 1639, when
Jacqueline Pascal was therefore only fourteen years of age.&nbsp;
It is in all respects a remarkable and interesting production,
both for the glimpse it gives of the great Cardinal in his hours
of ease, and its revelation of Jacqueline&rsquo;s own
character,&mdash;her dramatic cleverness, her firmness and wisdom
in assailing the Cardinal with her prepared verses at the right
moment, her self-conscious importance as the chief actor of such
a scene, and all the same, her girlish enjoyment of the
sweetmeats provided for her.&nbsp; It is a pleasant enough
picture; and it deserves especially to be noticed how prominently
the <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>scientific reputation of her brother, only two years
older than herself, is already recognised.</p>
<p>The sequel was all that could have been desired.&nbsp; The
father hastened, at the summons of his daughter, to pay his
respects to Richelieu, who gave him a welcome reception.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know all your merit,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
restore you to your children, and commend them to you.&nbsp; I
desire to do something considerable for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Within
two years &Eacute;tienne Pascal was, in consequence, appointed
Intendant of Rouen, where he settled with his family in
1641.&nbsp; Disturbances had arisen in Normandy at this time in
connection with the payment of taxes, and the Government,
believing that the Parliament at Rouen had not acted with
sufficient vigour, took the matter into their own hands, and sent
their officers to collect the revenues of the province. <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; &Eacute;tienne Pascal&rsquo;s
character and previous labours in this capacity, no less than his
restoration to the Cardinal&rsquo;s favour, pointed him out as a
man specially fitted for this work, which in the circumstances
was not unattended with danger.&nbsp; The work in itself was also
harassing and troublesome; and the youthful Pascal, anxious to
assist his father, had busied himself in the invention of a
machine for performing arithmetical calculations, which made a
great sensation at the time.&nbsp; Ingenious as the machine was,
it came to little, as we shall see in the next chapter, which
will be devoted to a brief account of Pascal&rsquo;s scientific
discoveries.&nbsp; In the meantime it will be better to confine
ourselves to the thread of his personal history up to the
important epoch which is known as his first conversion.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Settled at Rouen, he pursued his studies with
unremitting devotion, and with only too little regard for his
health.&nbsp; His elder sister, who might have won him
occasionally to lighter pursuits, was married to her cousin M.
P&eacute;rier in 1641, and two years afterwards went with him to
Clermont, where her husband was appointed a Counsellor in the
Court of Aides.&nbsp; Jacqueline was absorbed in her own poetical
studies, which received a special impetus from the friendship of
Corneille, who had returned at this time to his native
town.&nbsp; The illustrious dramatist speedily sought out the
Pascal family, and became one of their most intimate
associates.&nbsp; A prize being given every year for the best
copy of verses on the &ldquo;Conception of the Virgin,&rdquo; it
was awarded to certain verses of Jacqueline&rsquo;s for the year
1640.&nbsp; When the announcement of the result was made she was
absent, but a friend of the family rose and returned thanks in
verse in the name of the youthful poetess&mdash;<i>Pour une jeune
muse absente</i>.&nbsp; The friend was Corneille, whose impromptu
lines on the occasion, along with those of Jacqueline, are still
preserved. <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; Neither have much poetic merit,
but they recall an interesting incident.</p>
<p>A bright atmosphere of intellectual emulation and cheerful
prospects surrounds the family at this time.&nbsp; But all the
while it is evident, from Madame P&eacute;rier&rsquo;s account,
that her brother was injuring his health greatly in his undue
assiduity in his scientific pursuits.&nbsp; The attempts to
perfect the construction of his arithmetical machine seem
especially to have worn out his delicate frame, and to have laid
the foundation of the nervous <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>prostration
from which he more or less suffered all his life
afterwards.&nbsp; &ldquo;From the age of eighteen,&rdquo; she
says in a significant passage that her brother &ldquo;hardly ever
passed a day without pain.&nbsp; In the intermissions of his
sufferings, however, his spirit was such that he was constantly
bent on some new discovery.&rdquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>In the beginning of 1646 an accident happened which had
important consequences both to Pascal and his sisters.&nbsp;
&Eacute;tienne Pascal fell upon the ice and severely sprained his
foot.&nbsp; During his confinement he was attended by two
brothers who had acquired repute in the treatment of such
injuries.&nbsp; They were gentlemen of family in the
neighbourhood, who had devoted themselves to medicine and anatomy
from benevolent instincts and the love of these studies.&nbsp;
Both were disciples of a clergyman at Rouville, who was an
enthusiastic pietist and friend of St Cyran.&nbsp; Crowds flocked
to hear Pastor Guillebert whenever he preached, and many were
stirred by his eloquence to devote themselves to pious and
philanthropical labours.&nbsp; One of the brothers under this
inspiring guidance built a hospital at the end of his park, and
gave his children to the service of the Church in various
capacities.&nbsp; The other brother, who had no children,
provided beds in the hospital and attended the sick poor.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>The character and conversation of these men made a deep
impression upon the Pascal family.&nbsp; Hitherto esteemed pious,
they had not yet made religion an anxious concern in their
lives.&nbsp; Madame P&eacute;rier says expressly of her brother
that he had been &ldquo;preserved by the special protection of
God from all youthful vices, and, what was still more remarkable
in the case of a mind of such strength and pride, he had never
yielded to any libertinism of thought, but had always limited his
curiosity to natural inquiries.&rdquo;&nbsp; He attributed,
according to her statement, this religious sobriety of mind to
the instructions and example of his father, who had a great
respect for religion, and who had impressed upon him from his
infancy the maxim, &ldquo;that whatever is the object of faith
cannot be the object of reason, and still less the subject of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had seen, in his father, the combination of
scientific attainment with a strong reasoning power, and the
maxim therefore fell with weight from his lips.&nbsp; And so,
when he listened to the discourses of free-thinkers, young as he
was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He remained unmoved by them, and simply
looked upon them as men who had adopted the false principle that
the human reason is above everything, and who know nothing of the
real nature of faith; so that this spirit, so great and
inquisitive, which searched so carefully for the reason of
everything, was at the same time submissive as a child to all the
truths of religion, and this submissive simplicity predominated
in him through his whole life.&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a significant extract in more ways than one.&nbsp; In
the meantime we quote it as indicating the religious atmosphere
of Pascal&rsquo;s home, and the pious temper <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>which marked
him from the first.&nbsp; But as yet religion had not taken hold
of him with an absorbing enthusiasm.&nbsp; It had its place in
his thoughts, and this a deeply respectful place; but now, about
his twenty-third year, in communication with the two friends we
have mentioned, and under the same influence which had moved them
so deeply, it began to lay hold of him more powerfully.&nbsp; He
and his father and sisters read eagerly the books of St Cyran,
and of Jansen, the Bishop of Ypres, whose name became so
conspicuous in connection with Port Royal.&nbsp; A discourse by
the latter on &ldquo;The Reformation of the Inward Man,&rdquo;
and also Arnauld&rsquo;s &ldquo;Manual on Frequent
Communion,&rdquo; are supposed to have specially impressed
him.&nbsp; In the language of his sister&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Providence led him to the study of such
pious writings while he was not yet twenty-four years of age; and
God so enlightened him by this course of reading, that he came to
realise that the Christian religion obliges us to live only for
God, and to have no other object besides Him.&nbsp; So clear and
necessary appeared this truth to him, that he gave up for a time
all his researches, renounced all other knowledge, and applied
himself alone to the &lsquo;one thing needful&rsquo; spoken of by
our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This event is spoken of by Pascal&rsquo;s biographers as his
&ldquo;first conversion,&rdquo; and it appears to have been
attended not only with a zealous consecration of his own powers
to the service of religion, but moreover, as often happens in the
case of youthful enthusiasm, with a warm determination against
all who seemed to him to be acting at variance with the true
faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Although,&rdquo; as his sister says,
&ldquo;he had made no special study of scholastic <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>theology, he was not ignorant of the judgments of the
Church against the heresies invented by human subtlety.&nbsp; All
indications of heretical opinion excited his indignation, and God
gave him at this time an opportunity of testifying his zeal on
behalf of religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; She then adds in illustration
the following story:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was at Rouen at this time a man who
taught a new philosophy which attracted the curious.&nbsp; My
brother, pressed by two of his young friends, accompanied them to
hear this man; but they were greatly surprised when they found,
in conversation with him, that he drew consequences from his
philosophy at variance with the decisions of the Church.&nbsp; He
sought to prove by his arguments that the body of Jesus Christ
was not formed of the blood of the Holy Virgin, but of some other
matter specially created, and several other like subjects.&nbsp;
They pointed out to him his error, but he remained firm in his
opinions.&nbsp; Thereupon, taking into consideration how
dangerous it was to leave the instruction of youth in the hands
of a man with such erroneous opinions, they resolved, after
previously informing him of their intention, to denounce him if
he continued in his errors.&nbsp; So it happened; for he despised
their advice, and in such a manner, as to leave them no
alternative but to denounce him to M. du Bellay, <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a> who was then discharging episcopal
functions in the diocese of Rouen for the Archbishop.&nbsp; M. du
Bellay sent for the man, and having interrogated him, was
deceived by an equivocal confession of faith which he wrote and
subscribed.&nbsp; Otherwise he made little account of the affair
as reported by the three young men.&nbsp; However, when they saw
the confession of faith, they at once recognised its defects, and
entered into communication with the Archbishop himself, who,
having examined into the matter, saw its gravity, <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and
sent in writing a special order to M. du Bellay to make the man
retract all the points of which he was accused, and to receive
nothing from him except by communication of his accusers.&nbsp;
The order was carried out, and the result was that he appeared in
the council of the Archbishop and renounced all his
errors&mdash;it may be said sincerely, for he never showed any
anger towards those who had engaged in the affair, so as to lead
one to suppose that he had been himself deceived by the false
conclusions which he had drawn from false principles.&nbsp; It
was made plain that his accusers had no design of injuring him,
but only of undeceiving him, and so preventing him from seducing
the young, who were incapable of distinguishing the true from the
false in such subtle questions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story reflects somewhat doubtfully on Pascal&rsquo;s
fairness and good sense, even as told by Madame
P&eacute;rier.&nbsp; But it has not been left in the vagueness in
which it stands in her narrative.&nbsp; M. Cousin published for
the first time full details regarding it in the volume by which
he may be said to have initiated the new researches into the life
and writings of Pascal.&nbsp; These details, which fill more than
forty pages of appendix to M. Cousin&rsquo;s volume, <a
name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a> are no longer of any interest in
themselves; but they enable us to understand more clearly the
conduct of Pascal and his two friends.&nbsp; Unhappily they
deepen rather than lighten the shade which the story throws upon
Pascal&rsquo;s intemperate zeal.&nbsp; The name of the accused
teacher was Jacques Forton, a Capucin monk, known as the
P&egrave;re St Ange.&nbsp; He taught no <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>new
philosophy; but he had communicated to Pascal or his friends, in
private conversation specially desired by them, certain
theological opinions which he had espoused.&nbsp; These, as given
in the statement of the case signed by Pascal and his two
friends, mainly concern such abstruse subjects as the relation of
reason and faith, and the possibility of demonstrating the
doctrine of the Trinity as the source of all other
knowledge.&nbsp; The curious question as to the constitution of
the body of Jesus occupies only a subordinate place.&nbsp; The
monk, as shown in the whole proceedings, was evidently more of a
speculative dreamer than a heretic&mdash;a man fond of
disputation about matters beyond his comprehension.&nbsp; It is
mentioned by the three youthful zealots, in the
<i>r&eacute;cit</i> bearing their signature, that as they were
about to part with him, &ldquo;after the accustomed
civilities,&rdquo; he was careful to let them know that he
advanced the points in dispute, not as dogmas, but merely as
propositions or thoughts for discussion, the fruit of his own
reasonings.</p>
<p>There is no reason to doubt that Pascal&rsquo;s conduct on
this occasion arose entirely from honest zeal.&nbsp; He thought
religion compromised by the strange reasonings which he had
heard.&nbsp; There is as little doubt, however, that his zeal
outran his discretion.&nbsp; He showed a determination to pursue
the matter amounting to persecution.&nbsp; The worthy priest had
evidently no intention of promulgating heresy; for he is glad,
when called upon, of an opportunity of proving his
orthodoxy.&nbsp; With this view he produced, side by side with
the articles of accusation, passages from a former volume of his
which had been printed with official sanction.&nbsp; Pascal still
demurred, <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>even with this evidence before
him.&nbsp; A second declaration was obtained from the priest, and
the bishop refused to go further.&nbsp; The sympathies of the
community were evidently against the youthful zealots; and
finally Pascal&rsquo;s father, convinced that enough had been
done to vindicate the truth, successfully interposed as mediator.
<a name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a></p>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s health about this period appears to have
undergone a change for the worse.&nbsp; He suffered from
excessive headache and great internal heat and pain.&nbsp; A
singular characteristic of his malady was his inability to
swallow water unless it was heated, and even then only drop by
drop.&nbsp; He was the subject, also, of a remarkable paralytic
seizure thus described by his niece:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He fell,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;into a
very extraordinary state, as the result of his great application
to his scientific studies; for the senses (<i>les esprits</i>)
having mounted strongly to the brain, he became in a manner
paralysed from the waist downwards.&nbsp; His legs and feet grew
cold as marble; and they were obliged every day to put on socks
soaked in brandy in order to try and restore heat in his
feet.&nbsp; At the same time the physician interdicted him from
all study.&rdquo; <a name="citation23b"></a><a
href="#footnote23b" class="citation">[23b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>M. L&eacute;lut <a name="citation23c"></a><a
href="#footnote23c" class="citation">[23c]</a> explains at length
this attack of Pascal&rsquo;s as a well-known form of dynamical
paralysis, of a similar nature with hypochondria and hysteria,
proceeding from a disordered state of the nervous affections, the
result <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>of overwork acting upon a delicate
organisation.&nbsp; The result is temporary, as distinguished
from the paralysis arising from organic lesion, but indicates a
highly susceptible constitution, the ready prey of melancholy and
imaginative exaggeration, to which, in M. L&eacute;lut&rsquo;s
opinion, Pascal was more or less liable during the remaining
years of his life.</p>

25</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
PASCAL&rsquo;S SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.</h2>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s scientific studies may be said to have begun
with the remarkable incident of his youth already related, when
he elaborated for himself, in a solitary chamber without books,
thirty-two propositions of the first book of Euclid.&nbsp; On the
other hand, these studies may be said to have extended to his
closing years, when (in 1658 and 1659) he reverted to the
abstruser mathematics, and made the <i>cycloid</i> a subject of
special thought.&nbsp; But his scientific labours were in the
main concentrated in the eight or ten years of his life which
followed the removal of the family to Rouen.&nbsp; It will be
convenient, therefore, to notice these labours and discoveries in
a single chapter here, which will, at the same time, carry on the
main history of his life during these years.&nbsp; All that can
be expected from the present writer is a slight sketch of this
part of the subject, which indeed is all that would be
interesting to the general reader.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen Pascal had already acquired a scientific
reputation.&nbsp; He is spoken of by the Duchess
d&rsquo;Aiguillon, in the interview with Richelieu in which she
pleaded the cause of the exiled father, as &ldquo;very <!-- page
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>learned in mathematics;&rdquo; and when his sister
presented him after the dramatic representation on that occasion,
the Duchess gave him &ldquo;great commendation for his scientific
attainments.&rdquo; <a name="citation26a"></a><a
href="#footnote26a" class="citation">[26a]</a>&nbsp; When allowed
by his father to pursue the natural bent of his genius, he made
extraordinary progress.&nbsp; He was still only twelve years of
age, but Euclid&rsquo;s Elements, as soon as put into his hands,
were mastered by him without any explanation.&nbsp; By-and-by he
began to take an active part in the scientific discussions which
took place at his father&rsquo;s house; and his achievement in
Conic Sections has been already narrated.</p>
<p>Descartes&rsquo;s incredulity was not without reason; but
there is no room to doubt the fact.&nbsp; The little treatise,
&lsquo;Pour les Coniques,&rsquo; still survives.&nbsp; It bears
the date of 1640, and occupies only six pages. <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a>&nbsp; After a very clear statement of
his subject, the writer modestly concludes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have several other problems and
theorems, and several consequences deducible from the preceding;
but the mistrust which I have of my slight experience and
capacity does not permit me to advance more till my present
effort has passed the examination of able men who may oblige me
by looking at it.&nbsp; Afterwards, if they think it has
sufficient merit to be continued, we shall endeavour to push our
studies as far as God will give the power to conduct
them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to notice the beginning of relations betwixt
Descartes and Pascal, considering the jealousy that afterwards
arose betwixt them.&nbsp; There is something of this feeling from
the first in the older philosopher, <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>who was now
in the forty-fourth year of his age, and in the full zenith of
his great reputation.&nbsp; He appears to have been greatly
fascinated by Pascal&rsquo;s peculiar powers; but the men were of
too marked individuality of character, and too divergent in
intellectual sympathy and personal aspiration, to appreciate each
other fully.</p>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s next achievement was the invention of an
arithmetical machine, chiefly prompted by a desire to assist his
father in his official duties at Rouen.&nbsp; He has given us no
description of this machine from his own pen.&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;Avis&rdquo; addressed to all whose curiosity was excited
by it, he excuses himself from this task by the natural remark
that such a description would be useless without entering into a
number of technical details unintelligible to the general reader;
and that an actual inspection of it, combined with a brief
<i>viv&acirc; voce</i> explanation, would be far more
satisfactory than any lengthened account in writing.&nbsp; There
is an elaborate description, however, of the machine, by Diderot,
in the first volume of the &lsquo;Encyclop&eacute;die,&rsquo;
which is reprinted in the collection of Pascal&rsquo;s scientific
works.&nbsp; Pascal&rsquo;s main difficulties occurred, not in
connection with the invention itself, which he seems to have very
soon perfected according to his own conception, but with the
construction of the instrument after he had mentally worked it
out in all its details.&nbsp; These difficulties proved so great,
and so many imperfect specimens of the instrument were made,
that, in order to secure both his reputation and his interest, he
acquired in 1649 a special &ldquo;privil&eacute;ge du Roi,&rdquo;
which confined the manufacture of the machine to himself, and
such workmen as he should employ and sanction.&nbsp; All others,
&ldquo;of whatever quality and <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>condition,&rdquo; were prohibited from &ldquo;making it,
or causing it to be made, or selling it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But neither
these precautions nor the merits of the invention itself, which
were admitted by all competent judges, were of avail to make the
instrument a practical success.&nbsp; Many men of mathematical
and mechanical genius in different countries have applied
themselves to the same task.&nbsp; The celebrated Leibnitz is
said to have constructed a machine excelling Pascal&rsquo;s in
ingenuity and power.&nbsp; In our own time, Mr Babbage&rsquo;s
wonderful achievement in the same direction attracted wide
attention, and has been lavishly eulogised by Sir David Brewster
and others:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While all previous contrivances,&rdquo;
says Sir David, <a name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a> &ldquo;performed only particular
arithmetical operations, under a sort of copartnery between the
man and the machine, the extraordinary invention of Mr Babbage
actually substitutes mechanism in the place of man.&nbsp; A
problem is given to the machine, and it solves it by computing a
long series of numbers following some given law.&nbsp; In this
manner it calculates astronomical, logarithmic, and navigation
tables, as well as tables of the powers and products of
numbers.&nbsp; It can integrate, too, innumerable equations of
finite differences; and, in addition to these functions, it does
its work cheaply and quickly; <i>it corrects whatever errors are
accidentally committed</i>, <i>and it prints all its
calculations</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding this brilliant picture, the great expense and
the complications involved in the construction of such an
instrument have seriously interfered with its success.&nbsp; It
is said that Mr Babbage&rsquo;s machine, much more his marvellous
analytic engine, have never yet been properly constructed. <a
name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Pascal fortunately turned his thoughts into a new and
more fruitful channel.&nbsp; We have now to contemplate him as
one of an illustrious band associated in a great discovery in
physical science.&nbsp; Before his time considerable progress had
been made towards a knowledge of atmospheric pressure.&nbsp;
Galileo and his pupil Torricelli had both been busy with the
subject.&nbsp; To Pascal, however, remains the glory of carrying
successfully to a conclusion the suggestion of Torricelli, and of
verifying the results which he had indicated.&nbsp; Here, as in
almost all such discoveries, it is found that different minds
have been actively pursuing the same or similar lines of thought
and observation, and controversy has arisen as to the exact
merits of each; but Pascal has himself so candidly explained <a
name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a> how far he was indebted to his great
Italian predecessors, and how far he made original experiments of
his own, that both his relation to them and his own work stand
clearly apparent.</p>
<p>It had been found by the engineers engaged in the construction
of fountains for Cosmo dei Medici in Florence that they could not
raise water in an ordinary pump more than thirty-two feet above
the reservoir.&nbsp; The water, having reached this height, would
rise no higher.&nbsp; Galileo was appealed to for a solution of
the difficulty. <a name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a>&nbsp; Imbued with the ancient notion
that Nature abhors a <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>vacuum, and that this was, as then
prevalently believed, the explanation of the water following the
elevation of the piston in the pump, the philosopher replied in
effect that there were limits to the action of this principle,
and that Nature&rsquo;s abhorrence of a vacuum did not extend
beyond thirty-two feet.&nbsp; He was himself, it need hardly be
said, dissatisfied with such a reply, and accordingly he invited
his pupil, Torricelli, to investigate the subject.&nbsp; The
latter very soon found that the weight of the water was concerned
in the result.&nbsp; He made experiments with a heavier
fluid&mdash;mercury&mdash;and ascertained that a column of
mercury enclosed in a tube three feet in length hermetically
sealed at the lower end, and closed with the finger at the top,
on being inserted in a basin of the same liquid and the finger
withdrawn, stood at a height of about 28 inches in the
basin.&nbsp; As the specific gravities of water and mercury were
in the ratio of 32 feet and 28 inches, he was led to the
conclusion that the water in the pump and the mercury in the tube
at these respective heights exerted the same pressure on the same
base, and that both were of course counterbalanced by a
determinate force.&nbsp; But what was this force?&nbsp; He had
learned from Galileo that the air was a heavy fluid, and he was
carried, therefore, directly to the further conclusion that the
weight of the atmosphere was the counteracting cause in both
cases; in the one, pressing upon the reservoir from which the
water was drawn&mdash;and in the other, on the surrounding
mercury in the basin.&nbsp; He published his experiments and
researches in 1645, but dying soon afterwards, his conclusions
remained unverified.</p>
<p>The fame of Torricelli&rsquo;s experiments had reached Paris
as early as 1644, before their formal publication.&nbsp; Some
one, Pascal says, had communicated them to Father <!-- page
31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>Mersenne&mdash;both a religious and scientific intimate,
as we have already seen, of the Pascal family.&nbsp; Mersenne had
tried the experiments for himself, at first without success, but
soon with better fortune, after he had been to Rome and had
learned more fully about them.&nbsp; &ldquo;The news of these
having reached Rouen in 1646, where I then was,&rdquo; says
Pascal, <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> &ldquo;I made the Italian experiment,
founding on Mersenne&rsquo;s account, with great success.&nbsp; I
repeated it several times, and in this manner satisfying myself
of its accuracy, I drew certain conclusions from it, for the
proof of which I made new and very different experiments in
presence of four or five hundred people of all sorts, and amongst
others, five or six Jesuit fathers of the College of
Rouen.&rdquo;&nbsp; When his experiments became known in Paris,
he adds, they were confounded with those which had been made in
Italy, and the result was that some attributed to him a credit
which was not his due, while others, &ldquo;by a contrary
injustice,&rdquo; were disposed to take away the credit of what
he had really done.</p>
<p>It was with the view of placing the matter in a clear light,
and vindicating his own share in the train of experiments which
had been made, that he published in 1647 his &ldquo;Nouvelles
Exp&eacute;riences touchant le Vide,&rdquo; the first of his
hydrostatical treatises.&nbsp; He was at pains to explain the
distinction betwixt his own experiments and those which had been
made in Italy; and not content with this, he added in express
words, in an &ldquo;avis au lecteur,&rdquo; that he &ldquo;was
not the inventor of the original experiment, but that it had been
made in Italy four years before.&rdquo;&nbsp; So little, indeed,
did Pascal borrow directly from Torricelli, or seek to
appropriate the fruits of his researches, that he was as yet
ignorant of the <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>explanation which the Italian had
suggested of the phenomenon so fully established.&nbsp; He saw,
of course, that the old maxim of Nature abhorring a vacuum had no
solid foundation; but he tried to account for the vacuum above
the water and the mercury by such a supposition as the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That it contained no portion of either of
these fluids, or of any matter appreciable by the senses; that
all bodies have a repugnance to separate from a state of
continuity, and admit a vacuum between them; that this repugnance
is not greater for a large vacuum than a small one; that its
measure is a column of water about 32 feet in height, and that
beyond this limit a great or small vacuum is formed above the
water with the same facility, provided that no foreign obstacle
interfere to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s treatise, while still retaining so much of the
old traditional physics, was made an object of lively attack by
the Jesuit Rector of the College of Paris, Stephen
No&euml;l.&nbsp; Pascal replied to him at first directly; and
then in answer to a second attack&mdash;and so far also in answer
to a treatise by the Jesuit, entitled &ldquo;Le Plein du
Vide,&rdquo; published in 1648&mdash;he made a more elaborate
statement in a letter addressed to M. le Pailleur, and in a
further letter addressed to Father No&euml;l in the same
year.&nbsp; There can hardly be any doubt that this was the
commencement of Pascal&rsquo;s hostile relations with the
Jesuits.&nbsp; On their part, they failed not to remember in
after years, and in a more serious struggle, that he was an old
enemy; whilst he on his part probably drew something of the
contemptuous scorn which he poured upon them from the
recollection of their obstinate ignorance in matters of
science.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in defending himself from the attacks of <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>ignorance, Pascal did not fail to open his own mind to
fuller scientific light.&nbsp; As soon as the explanation of
Torricelli was communicated to him, he accepted it without
hesitation, and resolved to carry out a further series of
experiments with the view of verifying this explanation, and of
banishing for ever the scholastic nonsense of Nature&rsquo;s
abhorrence of a vacuum.&nbsp; If the weight of the air was really
the cause which sustained the height of the mercury in the
Torricellian tube, he saw at once that this height would vary at
different elevations, according to the varying degree of
atmospheric pressure at these elevations.&nbsp; He proceeded
accordingly to test the result; but the higher levels around
Rouen were too insignificant to enable him to draw any decisive
inference.&nbsp; Accordingly, he communicated with his
brother-in-law in Auvergne with the view of having an adequate
experiment made during an ascent of the Puy de D&ocirc;me, which
rises in the neighbourhood of Clermont to a height of about 3000
feet.&nbsp; The state of his own health prevented him from
conducting the experiment personally, and M. P&eacute;rier was
detained by professional avocations from undertaking it
immediately.&nbsp; But at length, in September 1648, the
experiment was carried out successfully, and the results
communicated to Pascal.&nbsp; I cannot do better than quote the
account of this important event as rendered by an eminent
scientific authority, <a name="citation33"></a><a
href="#footnote33" class="citation">[33]</a> from M.
P&eacute;rier&rsquo;s own recital of the facts in his letter to
Pascal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the morning of Saturday, the 19th
September, the day fixed for the interesting observation, the
weather was unsettled; but about five o&rsquo;clock the summit of
the Puy <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>de D&ocirc;me began to appear through
the clouds, and P&eacute;rier resolved to proceed with the
experiment.&nbsp; The leading characters in Clermont, whether
ecclesiastics or laymen, had taken a deep interest in the
subject, and had requested P&eacute;rier to give them notice of
his plans.&nbsp; He accordingly summoned his friends, and at
eight in the morning there assembled in the garden of the
P&egrave;res Minimes, about a league below the town, M. Bannier,
of the P&egrave;res Minimes; M. Mosnier, canon of the cathedral
church; along with MM. la Ville and Begon, counsellors of the
Court of Aides, and M. la Porte, doctor and professor of medicine
in Clermont.&nbsp; These five individuals were not only
distinguished in their respective professions, but also by their
scientific acquirements; and M. P&eacute;rier expresses his
delight at having been on this occasion associated with
them.&nbsp; M. P&eacute;rier began the experiment by pouring into
a vessel 16 lb. of quicksilver, which he had rectified during the
three preceding days.&nbsp; He then took two glass tubes, four
feet long, of the same bore, and hermetically sealed at one end
and open at the other; and making the ordinary experiment of a
vacuum with both, he found that the mercury stood in each of them
at the same level and at the height of 26 inches 3&frac12;
lines.&nbsp; This experiment was repeated twice, with the same
result.&nbsp; One of these glass tubes, with the mercury standing
in it, was left under the care of M. Chastin, one of the
Religious of the House, who undertook to observe and mark any
changes in it that might take place during the day; and the party
already named set out with the other tube for the summit of the
Puy de D&ocirc;me, about 500 toises (a toise is about six feet in
length) above their first station.&nbsp; Before arriving there,
they found that the mercury stood at the height of 23 inches and
2 lines&mdash;no less than 3 inches and 1&frac12; line lower than
it stood at the Minimes.&nbsp; The party were &lsquo;struck with
admiration and astonishment <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>at this
result;&rsquo; and &lsquo;so great was their surprise that they
resolved to repeat the experiment under various
forms.&rsquo;&nbsp; The glass tube, or the barometer, as we may
call it, was placed in various positions on the summit of
&lsquo;the mountain&rsquo;&mdash;sometimes in the small chapel
which is there; sometimes in an exposed and sometimes in a
sheltered position; sometimes when the wind blew, and sometimes
when it was calm; sometimes in rain, and sometimes in a fog: and
under all these various influences, which fortunately took place
during the same day, the quicksilver stood at the same height of
23 inches 2 lines.&nbsp; During their descent of the mountain
they repeated the experiment at <i>Lafon-de-l&rsquo;Arbre</i>, an
intermediate station, nearer the Minimes than the summit of the
Puy, &lsquo;and they found the mercury to stand at the height of
25 inches&mdash;a result with which the party was greatly
pleased,&rsquo; as indicating the relation between the height of
the mercury and the height of the station.&nbsp; Upon reaching
the Minimes, they found that the mercury had not changed its
height, notwithstanding the inconstancy of the weather, which had
been alternately clear, windy, rainy, and foggy.&nbsp; M.
P&eacute;rier repeated the experiments with both the glass tubes,
and found the height of the mercury to be still 26 inches
3&frac12; lines.&nbsp; On the following morning M. de la Marc,
priest of the Oratory, to whom M. P&eacute;rier had mentioned the
preceding results, proposed to have the experiment repeated at
the top and bottom of the towers of Notre Dame in Clermont.&nbsp;
He accordingly yielded to his request, and found the difference
to be 2 lines.&nbsp; Upon comparing these observations, M.
P&eacute;rier obtained the following results, showing the changes
in the altitude of the mercurial column corresponding to certain
differences of altitude of position:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>When Pascal received these results,
all the difficulties were removed; and perceiving from the two
last observations in the preceding table that 20 toises, or about
120 feet, produce a change of 2 lines, and 7 toises, or 42 feet,
a change of &frac12; a line, he made the observation at the top
and bottom of the tower of St Jacques de la Boucherie, which was
about 24 or 25 toises, or about 150 feet high, and he found a
difference of more than 2 lines in the mercurial column; and in a
private house 90 steps high he found a difference of &frac12; a
line. . . .&nbsp; After this important experiment was made,
Pascal intimated to M. P&eacute;rier that different states of the
weather would occasion differences in the barometer, according as
it was cold, hot, dry, or moist; and in order to put this opinion
to the test of experiment, M. P&eacute;rier instituted a series
of observations, which he continued from the beginning of 1649
till March 1651.&nbsp; Corresponding observations were made at
the same time at Paris and at Stockholm by the French ambassador,
M. Chanut, and Descartes; and from these it appeared that the
mercury rises in weather which is cold, cloudy, and damp, and
falls when the weather is hot and dry, and during rain and snow,
but still with such irregularities that no general rule could be
established.&nbsp; At Clermont the difference between the highest
and the lowest state of the mercury was 1 inch 3&frac12; lines;
at Paris the same; and at Stockholm 2 inches 2&frac12;
lines.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the account here presented of these researches, there is
no difficulty in determining the exact credit due to Pascal on
the one hand, and his Italian predecessors on the other.&nbsp; He
completed what they had begun, and verified what they had
indicated.&nbsp; As the Abb&eacute; Bossut has expressed it,
Galileo proved that air was a heavy fluid; Torricelli conceived
that its weight was the cause of the suspension of the water in a
pump and the mercury in a tube.&nbsp; Pascal demonstrated that
this was the fact.&nbsp; No one was more anxious than Pascal
himself <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>that Torricelli should be
acknowledged as the real discoverer of the principle which it was
left to him to establish by the test of experiment.&nbsp; He
claimed, however, his own definite share in the discovery, both
as having carried on a series of independent experiments, and as
having converted what he himself calls the
&ldquo;conjecture&rdquo; of Torricelli into an established
fact.&nbsp; It was painful to him, therefore, to have this share
denied, and even open accusations made against him that he had
appropriated, without acknowledgment, the results of
Torricelli&rsquo;s researches.&nbsp; This accusation was made in
certain theses of philosophy maintained in the Jesuit College of
Montferrand in 1651, and dedicated to Pascal&rsquo;s own friend,
M. de Ribeyre, first president at the Court of Aides at
Clermont.&nbsp; Pascal&rsquo;s name was not indeed mentioned in
these theses; but there could be no doubt of the allusion made to
&ldquo;certain persons loving novelty&rdquo; who claimed to be
the inventors of a definite experiment of which Torricelli was
the real author.&nbsp; It was this accusation which drew from
Pascal his letter to M. Ribeyre, bearing the date of 12th July of
the same year, in which he has described, with admirable lucidity
and temper, his relations to the whole subject.&nbsp; In this
letter he distinctly says that the Italian experiments were known
in France from the year 1644; that they were repeated in France
by several persons in several places during 1646; that he himself
had made, as we have already seen, definite experiments in 1647,
and published the results in the same year; and that he had then
not mentioned the name of Torricelli, because, while he knew that
the experiments were made in Italy four years before, he did not
then know that the experimenter was Torricelli; but <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>that
so soon as he learned this fact&mdash;which he and his friends
were so eager to know, that they sent a special letter of inquiry
to Rome&mdash;he was &ldquo;ravished with the idea that the
experimenter was so illustrious a genius, whose mathematical
writings, already well known, surpassed those of all
antiquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says, in conclusion, that it was only
in the same year (1647), after the publication of his own
researches, that he learned &ldquo;the very fine thought&rdquo;
of Torricelli concerning the cause of all the effects which had
been attributed to the horror of a vacuum.&nbsp; But &ldquo;as
this was only a conjecture as yet unverified,&rdquo; he then,
with the view of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of it,
conceived the plan of the experiments carried out by M.
P&eacute;rier at the top and the foot of the Puy de
D&ocirc;me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is true, sir,&rdquo; he adds,
&ldquo;and I say it boldly, that this series of experiments was
my own invention; and therefore I may say that the new knowledge
thus acquired is entirely due to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this letter M. Ribeyre made a satisfactory and touching
reply.&nbsp; He expresses disapproval of the allusion of the
Jesuit father, but as the discourse was otherwise free from
offence, he was willing to attribute it to a &ldquo;pardonable
emulation among <i>savants</i>,&rdquo; rather than to any
intention of assailing Pascal.&nbsp; He makes, in short, the best
excuse he can for the Jesuit, and hastens to assure Pascal that
his reputation needed no justification:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Your candour and your sincerity are too
well known to admit any belief that you could do anything
inconsistent with the virtuous profession apparent in all your
actions and manner.&nbsp; I honour and revere your virtue more
than your science; and as in both the one and the other you equal
the <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>most famous of the age, do not think it strange if,
adding to the common esteem which all have of you, a friendship
contracted many years ago with your father, I subscribe myself
yours,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Pascal had to sustain suspicion and attack in a quarter
more formidable than that of the Jesuit fathers at
Montferrand.&nbsp; We have already spoken of the rather unhappy
commencement of relations between him and Descartes.&nbsp;
Farther on we get a more pleasant glimpse of these relations, in
a letter from Jacqueline Pascal to Madame P&eacute;rier, dated
25th September 1647, and apparently shortly after Pascal had
retired to Paris, along with his younger sister, leaving their
father for some time still at Rouen.&nbsp; This letter is so
interesting, both in its bearing on the question which arose
between Descartes and Pascal, and in itself, as giving the only
account we have of personal intercourse between these two
illustrious men, that we present it almost entire:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have delayed writing to you,&rdquo;
Jacqueline says, addressing her sister, <a
name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a> &ldquo;because I wished to tell to you
at length of the interview of M. Descartes and my brother, and I
had no leisure yesterday to say that on the evening of Sunday
last M. Habert <a name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b"
class="citation">[39b]</a> came, accompanied by M. de Montigny, a
gentleman of Brittany, with the view of letting me know, in the
absence of my brother, who was at church, that M. Descartes, his
compatriot and good friend, had expressed a strong desire to see
my brother, for the sake of the great esteem in which both he and
my father were everywhere held, and that he begged to be allowed
to wait upon him next day at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
if this would not inconvenience him, whom he knew to be an
invalid.&nbsp; <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>When M. de Montigny proposed this, I
felt hindered from giving a definite answer, because I knew that
my brother was reluctant to force himself to conversation,
especially in the morning.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I did not think it
right to refuse, so we arranged that he should come at half-past
ten next day.&nbsp; Along with M. Habert and M. de Montigny there
were also a young man in the dress of a priest, whom I did not
know, M. de Montigny&rsquo;s son, and two or three other young
people.&nbsp; M. de Roberval, whom my brother had informed of the
intended visit, was also present.&nbsp; After some civilities,
talk fell upon the instrument [probably that which Pascal had
used in the experiments], which was very much admired, while M.
de Roberval showed it.&nbsp; Then they spoke of the idea of a
vacuum; and M. Descartes, on hearing of the experiments, and
being asked what he thought was within the tube (<i>dans la
seringue</i>), said with great seriousness that it was some
subtle matter, to which my brother replied what he could.&nbsp;
M. Roberval, believing that my brother had difficulty in
speaking, took up the reply to M. Descartes with some heat, yet
with perfect civility.&nbsp; M. Descartes answered with some
harshness that he would talk to my brother as much as he wished,
because he spoke with reason, but not to any one who spoke with
prejudice.&nbsp; Thereupon, finding from his watch it was
mid-day, he rose, being engaged to dine at the Faubourg Saint
Germain.&nbsp; M. Roberval also rose, in such a way that M.
Descartes conducted him to a carriage, where the two were alone,
and battled at one another more strongly than playfully, as M.
Roberval, who returned here after dinner, told us. . . .&nbsp; I
have forgotten to tell you that M. Descartes, annoyed at seeing
so little of my brother, promised to return next day at eight
o&rsquo;clock. . . .&nbsp; He desired this, partly to consult
regarding my brother&rsquo;s illness, as to which, however, he
did not communicate anything of importance, only he counselled
him to remain in bed every day as long as he could till he was
tired, and to take plenty of soup.&nbsp; They spoke of many other
things, for he was here till eleven o&rsquo;clock, but I cannot
tell you more particularly what they said, as I was not present
on this occasion.&nbsp; We were prevented during <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>the
whole day from making him take his early bath.&nbsp; He had found
it give him a little headache, but that was because he had taken
it too late; and I believe the bleeding at the foot on Sunday had
done him good, for on Monday he conversed freely and strongly all
day&mdash;in the morning with M. Descartes, and after dinner with
M. de Roberval, with whom he argued for a long time on many
things, both belonging to theology and physics, and yet he took
no further harm than perspiring much, and slept rather sound
during the night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The revelations of this letter are very curious.&nbsp; The
respectful desire of Descartes, already so distinguished, to make
Pascal&rsquo;s acquaintance, and to enter into conversation with
him; his resentment of Roberval&rsquo;s interference, and their
earnest altercation, prolonged in the carriage after leaving
Pascal&rsquo;s house; the evidently serious character of
Pascal&rsquo;s maladies, and the watchful attention of his
sister.&nbsp; It is clear through all that Descartes had been
busily occupied with the same physical problems as Pascal, and
that he was somewhat jealous of the results towards which Pascal
and his friends were tending.&nbsp; Evidently there was a certain
measure of unfriendliness between Roberval and Descartes.&nbsp; I
am unable, however, to see any traces of a coterie surrounding
Pascal and inimical to Descartes, as M. Cousin suggests. <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; If such a coterie existed at this
time in Paris, of which the &ldquo;hasty and jealous
Roberval&rdquo; was the centre, and which delighted in
&ldquo;abusing Descartes, and attacking him on all sides,&rdquo;
Jacqueline&rsquo;s frank and lively letter seems enough to show
that while Roberval was Pascal&rsquo;s friend and
Descartes&rsquo;s disputant, there was nothing in the <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>meantime between Descartes and Pascal but courteous
friendliness and a cordial feeling of mutual respect.</p>
<p>Descartes, however, in his retirement at Stockholm, plainly
cherished the impression that Roberval&rsquo;s intimacy with
Pascal prevented the latter from doing full justice to his
scientific position and suggestions; and having as yet heard
nothing, in June 1649, of the special results of Pascal&rsquo;s
experiments on the Puy de D&ocirc;me in the preceding year, he
wrote to his friend Carcavi to let him know about these.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I pray you, let me know of the success of
an experiment which Pascal is said to have made on the mountains
of Auvergne. . . .&nbsp; I had the right to expect this of him
rather than of you, because it was I who advised him two years
ago to make the experiment, and who assured him that, although I
had not made it, I had no doubt of its success.&nbsp; But <i>as
he is the friend of M. Roberval</i>, <i>who professes not to be
mine</i>, <i>I have some reason to think he follows the passions
of his friend</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation42a"></a><a
href="#footnote42a" class="citation">[42a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That letter was immediately communicated to Pascal by Carcavi,
who was his intimate associate no less than Roberval.&nbsp; But
it seems to have elicited no reply.&nbsp; Bossut <a
name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b"
class="citation">[42b]</a> says that he despised it.&nbsp; On the
other hand, Descartes&rsquo;s biographer and eulogist, Baillet,
blames Pascal for having carefully kept out of view
Descartes&rsquo;s name in all the accounts of his discoveries;
and produces an array of passages from Descartes&rsquo;s letters,
showing <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>plainly that his mind was in the line
of discovery finally verified by the experiments in Auvergne. <a
name="citation43a"></a><a href="#footnote43a"
class="citation">[43a]</a>&nbsp; It may be granted beyond doubt
this was the case.&nbsp; It would ill become any admirer of
Pascal to detract from the glory of Descartes.&nbsp; But it must
be held no less firmly, that in the personal question raised by
Descartes&rsquo;s letter, the balance of evidence is all in
favour of Pascal.&nbsp; There are no indications that the two men
ever met save on the occasion so frankly described by his sister
Jacqueline.&nbsp; Before this Pascal had not only been busy with
the subject, but says distinctly that he had meditated the
experiment finally made on the Puy de D&ocirc;me from the time
that he published his first researches. <a
name="citation43b"></a><a href="#footnote43b"
class="citation">[43b]</a>&nbsp; It was not, indeed, till about
six weeks after Descartes&rsquo;s visit, or on the 15th December
1647, that he communicated with M. P&eacute;rier regarding these
experiments, and his earnest desire that they should be made; and
it was not till the following September, or about a year after
Descartes&rsquo;s visit, that they were actually made.&nbsp; But
it is incredible that Pascal could have written as he did if he
had really, for the first time, been indebted to Descartes for
the suggestion.&nbsp; Descartes&rsquo;s name is not mentioned in
his correspondence with M. P&eacute;rier, nor in any of his
writings on the subject; and the delay in making the experiments
is sufficiently explained by the facts stated by himself, that
they could only be made effectually at <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>some place of
greater elevation than he could command&mdash;such as
&ldquo;Clermont, at the foot of the Puy de
D&ocirc;me&rdquo;&mdash;and by some person, such as M.
P&eacute;rier, on whose knowledge and accuracy he could
rely.&nbsp; If we add to this the force of the statement already
quoted from his letter to M. Ribeyre, four years afterwards, or
in 1651, that he claimed the experiments as entirely &ldquo;his
own invention,&rdquo; and that he did so &ldquo;boldly,&rdquo;
the case seems put beyond all doubt&mdash;unless we are to
suppose the author of the &lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;Thoughts&rsquo; capable of wilful suppression of the
truth.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is unnecessary to attribute to
Descartes anything beyond a mistaken opinion of the value of
certain statements which he had no doubt made to Pascal, and
possibly some confusion of memory.&nbsp; And that this is not an
unwarranted view appears from what he says in a subsequent letter
to M. Carcavi, on the 17th August of the same year,
1649&mdash;that he was greatly interested in hearing of the
success of the experiments, having two years before besought
Pascal to make them, and assured him of success&mdash;because the
supposed explanation was one, he adds, &ldquo;entirely consistent
with the principles of my philosophy, apart from which he
[Pascal], would not have thought of it, his own opinion being
quite contrary.&rdquo; <a name="citation44"></a><a
href="#footnote44" class="citation">[44]</a>&nbsp; This may or
may not be true.&nbsp; Pascal certainly held as long as he could
to the old maxim of &ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s abhorrence of a
vacuum.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not think it allowable,&rdquo;
he says in his letter to M. P&eacute;rier, &ldquo;to depart
lightly from maxims handed down to us by <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>antiquity,
unless compelled by invincible proofs.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
notions of Descartes on the subject of a vacuum were at least as
confused as those originally held by Pascal. <a
name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a"
class="citation">[45a]</a>&nbsp; It is absurd, therefore, to
suppose that the latter could have been indebted to the
principles of the Cartesian philosophy&mdash;not to say that this
is a very different suggestion from that of the former letter,
that Descartes himself had advised the experiment to be
made.&nbsp; Evidently the older philosopher wrote under vague and
somewhat inflated ideas of the value of his labours and his
conversation with Pascal; while the latter, again, absorbed in
his own thoughts on the subject, and unconscious that he had
received any special impulse from Descartes or his philosophy,
naturally made no mention of his name.&nbsp; His silence when
Descartes&rsquo;s accusation was communicated to him indicates
the same somewhat lofty reserve and confidence in the
independence of his own researches, rather than any
contempt.&nbsp; He felt too sure of his position to think of
defending himself, or of repelling what he no doubt regarded as
not so much a deliberate assault on the value of his own work, as
an exaggerated estimate by the other of his share in that
work.</p>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s researches regarding atmospheric pressure
conducted him gradually to the examination of the general laws of
the equilibrium of fluids. <a name="citation45b"></a><a
href="#footnote45b" class="citation">[45b]</a>&nbsp; It had been
already determined that the pressure of a fluid on its base is as
the product of the base multiplied by the height of the fluid,
and that all fluids press equally on all sides of <!-- page
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>the
vessels enclosing them.&nbsp; But it still remained to determine
exactly the measure of the pressure, in order to deduce the
general conditions of equilibrium.&nbsp; With the view of
ascertaining this, Pascal made two unequal apertures in a vessel
filled with fluid, and enclosed on all sides.&nbsp; He then
applied two pistons to these apertures, pressed by forces
proportional to the respective apertures, and the fluid remained
<i>in equilibrio</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Having established this truth
by two methods equally ingenious and satisfactory, he deduced
from it the different cases of the equilibrium of fluids, and
particularly with solid bodies, compressible and incompressible,
when either partly or wholly immersed in them.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But the most remarkable part of his
treatise on the &lsquo;Equilibrium of Fluids,&rsquo;&rdquo;
continues Sir David Brewster, from whose exposition we quote, <a
name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a> &ldquo;and one which of itself would
have immortalised him, is his application of the general
principle to the construction of what he calls the
&lsquo;mechanical machine for multiplying forces,&rsquo; <a
name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a>&mdash;an effect which, he says, may be
produced to any extent we choose, as one may by means of this
machine raise a weight of any magnitude.&nbsp; This new machine
is the <i>Hydrostatic Press</i>, first introduced by our
celebrated countryman, Mr Bramah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pascal&rsquo;s treatise on the weight of the whole mass
of air forms the basis of the modern science of Pneumatics.&nbsp;
In order to prove that the mass of air presses by its weight on
all the bodies which it surrounds, and also that it is elastic
and compressible, a balloon half filled with air was carried to
the top of the Puy de D&ocirc;me.&nbsp; It gradually inflated
itself as it ascended, and when it reached the summit it was
quite full and swollen, as if fresh air had been blown into it;
or <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>what is the same thing, it swelled in proportion as the
weight of the column of air which pressed upon it
diminished.&nbsp; When again brought down, it became more and
more flaccid, and, when it reached the bottom, it resumed its
original condition.&nbsp; In the nine chapters of which the
treatise consists, he shows that all the phenomena or effects
hitherto ascribed to the horror of a vacuum, arise from the
weight of the mass of air; and after explaining the variable
pressure of the atmosphere in different localities, and in its
different states, and the rise of the water in pumps, he
calculates that the whole mass of air round our globe weighs
8,983,889,440,000,000,000 French pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having thus completed his researches respecting elastic
and incompressible fluids, Pascal seems to have resumed with a
fatal enthusiasm his mathematical studies: but, unfortunately for
science, several of the works which he composed have been
lost.&nbsp; Others, however, have been preserved, which entitle
him to a high rank amongst the greatest mathematicians of the
age.&nbsp; Of these, his &lsquo;Trait&eacute; du Triangle
Arithm&eacute;tique,&rsquo; his &lsquo;Tractatus de Numericis
Ordinibus,&rsquo; and his &lsquo;Problemata de Cycloide,&rsquo;
are the chief.&nbsp; By means of the <i>Arithmetical
Triangle</i>, an invention equally ingenious and original, he
succeeded in solving a number of theorems which it would have
been difficult to demonstrate in any other way, and in finding
the coefficients of different terms of a binomial raised to an
even and positive power.&nbsp; The same principles enabled him to
lay the foundation of the doctrine of probabilities, an important
branch of mathematical science, which Huyghens, a few years
afterwards, improved, and which the Marquis la Place and M.
Poisson have so greatly extended.&nbsp; These treatises, with the
exception of that on the Cycloid, were composed and printed in
the year 1654, but were not published till 1668, after the death
of the author.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s discoveries as to the cycloid belong to a later
period of his life, after he had long forsaken the scientific
studies which engrossed him at this time, <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>and had
become an inmate of Port Royal.&nbsp; But, as we have already
said, it is well to complete our view of his scientific labours
in a single chapter.</p>
<p>During an access of severe toothache which, in 1658, deprived
him of sleep, his thoughts fastened on certain problems connected
with the cycloid.&nbsp; Fermat, Roberval, and Torricelli had all
been occupied with the subject, and made some definite progress
in ascertaining its properties.&nbsp; But much still remained to
be done, and especially to resolve the problems connected with it
in a &ldquo;general and uniform manner.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pascal,&rdquo; says Bossut, &ldquo;devised within eight
days, and in the midst of cruel sufferings, a method which
embraced all the problems&mdash;a method founded upon the
summation of certain series, of which he had given the elements
in his writings accompanying his &lsquo;Trait&eacute; du Triangle
Arithm&eacute;tique.&rsquo;&nbsp; From this discovery there was
only a step to that of the Differential and Integral Calculus;
and it may be confidently presumed that, if Pascal had proceeded
with his mathematical studies, he would have anticipated Leibnitz
and Newton in the glory of their great invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having communicated the result of his geometrical meditation
to the Duc de Roannez and some of his other religious friends,
they conceived the design of making it subservient to the triumph
of religion.&nbsp; Pascal himself was an illustrious example that
the highest mathematical genius and the humblest Christian piety
might be united; but in order to give <i>&eacute;clat</i> to such
an example, his friends proposed to propound publicly the
questions solved by the great Port Royalist in his moments of
suffering, and to offer prizes for the <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>best
solutions given of them.&nbsp; This they did in June 1658.&nbsp;
A programme was published making the offer of prizes of forty and
twenty pistoles, for the best determination of the area and the
centre of gravity of any segment of the cycloid, and the
dimensions and centres of gravity of solids and half and quarter
solids which the same curve would generate by revolving round an
abscissa and an ordinate.&nbsp; The programme was put forth in
the name of Amos Dettonville, the anagram of Pascal&rsquo;s
assumed name as the writer of the &lsquo;Provincial
Letters.&rsquo;&nbsp; Huyghens, Sluzsius, a canon of the
Cathedral of Li&egrave;ge, and Wren, the architect of St
Paul&rsquo;s, sent in partial solutions of the
problems&mdash;those of Wren especially attracting the interest
of both Fermat and Roberval.&nbsp; But Wallis, of Oxford, and
Lallou&egrave;re, a Jesuit of Toulouse, were the only two
competitors who treated all the problems proposed.&nbsp; It was
held that they had not completely succeeded in solving them; and
Dettonville published his own solution in an elaborate letter
addressed to M. Carcavi, and in a treatise on the subject.&nbsp;
Carcavi was an old friend of Pascal&rsquo;s father as well as of
himself; and being a lawyer as well as a mathematician, the
arrangement of the affair seems to have been intrusted to
him.&nbsp; This did not save him, however, from attacks by the
disappointed candidates, who accused him of unfairness; and
Leibnitz has given his decision that both Wallis and
Lallou&egrave;re, in the treatises which they
published,&mdash;which did not, however, appear till after
Pascal&rsquo;s,&mdash;had succeeded in solving the
problems.&nbsp; Upon such a point we cannot pretend to judge; but
it may be safely said that the design of the Duc de Roannez was
hardly realised in the issue.&nbsp; <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>It was
sufficiently proved, indeed, that Pascal, in the midst of all his
austerities and devotional exercises, was the same Pascal who had
held his own both with Descartes and with the Jesuits.&nbsp; But
the life of thought which survived in him no sooner touched the
outer world of intellectual ambition, than it flamed forth into
something of the passion of controversy which his pen had already
kindled in another direction.&nbsp; Religion is best vindicated,
not in the strifes of science, but by the beauty of its own
activities.</p>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s labours on the cycloid may be said to bring to
a close his scientific career.&nbsp; There is still one
invention, however, of a very practical kind, associated with the
very last months of his life.&nbsp; Amongst the letters of Madame
P&eacute;rier, there is one of date March 24, 1662, addressed to
M. Arnauld de Pompone <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a>&mdash;a nephew of
the great Arnauld&mdash;in which she gives a lively description
of the success of an experiment &ldquo;dans l&rsquo;affaire des
carrosses.&rdquo;&nbsp; The affair was nothing less than the
trial on certain routes in Paris of what is now known as an
&ldquo;omnibus;&rdquo; and the idea of such conveyances for the
public&mdash;&ldquo;carrosses &agrave; cinq sols,&rdquo; as they
were called&mdash;is attributed to Pascal.&nbsp; It is certain
that the privilege of running &ldquo;carrosses &agrave; cinq
sols&rdquo; was granted to Pascal&rsquo;s friend, the Duc de
Roannez, and to other noblemen, by royal patent, in January
1662,&mdash;and that the experiment, as described by Madame
P&eacute;rier, was made with great success in the following
March, and that Pascal had an active interest in the
undertaking.&nbsp; His sister tells that he had mortgaged his
share of its first year&rsquo;s profits in order to provide <!--
page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>for the poor at Blois; <a name="citation51"></a><a
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a> and a note from his
own hand, appended to his sister&rsquo;s letter, shows with what
eagerness he entered into the affair and hailed its
success.&nbsp; It is singular to connect the name of Pascal, and
that, too, during the last sad months of his life, with so
world-wide a commonplace as the omnibus.</p>
<h2><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
PASCAL IN THE WORLD.</h2>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s health, we have seen, was very delicate.&nbsp;
His labours to perfect his arithmetical machine had seriously
impaired it.&nbsp; The attack of partial paralysis, described by
his niece, seems to have taken place in the early summer of
1647.&nbsp; As soon as he was able, he removed to Paris, where we
find him settled with his younger sister in September of the same
year.&nbsp; It was on the twenty-fifth of this month that
Jacqueline writes from Paris of Descartes&rsquo;s memorable
visits.&nbsp; One of the motives of his change of residence was
no doubt to consult the best physicians of the day; and
Descartes, who, amongst his other numerous gifts, had some skill
in medicine, made his second visit to him partly as a
physician.&nbsp; &ldquo;He came in part,&rdquo; says Jacqueline,
&ldquo;to consult as to my brother&rsquo;s illness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He appears to have given him very sound advice, which,
unfortunately, Pascal did not follow&mdash;&ldquo;to lie in bed
as much as he could, and take strong soup.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
contrary, he was &ldquo;bled, bathed, and purged,&rdquo; after
the usual medical routine of the time, apparently without any
good effects, or any alleviation of his sufferings.</p>
<p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>The father also returned to Paris in May 1648.&nbsp; The
Provincial Parliament, with regained authority, had exacted the
recall of the Intendants appointed by the Court.&nbsp;
&Eacute;tienne Pascal&rsquo;s services were remunerated by the
dignity of a Counsellor of State, and he was set at liberty to
rejoin his children.&nbsp; It was at this period that the
struggle took place betwixt father and daughter as to the
latter&rsquo;s determination to choose a religious life.&nbsp;
Encouraged by her brother after his access of zeal at Rouen,
Jacqueline was gradually more and more drawn towards piety.&nbsp;
After their settlement in Paris they went frequently together to
the Church of Port Royal de Paris, to listen to the sermons of M.
Singlin, whose touching pictures of the beauty and perfection of
the Christian life awoke in the youthful enthusiast the desire of
entering Port Royal.&nbsp; She opened personal communications
with the sainted head of the House, the M&egrave;re
Ang&eacute;lique, and also with M. Singlin, who recognised in her
all the marks of a true vocation, but who would not allow her to
proceed further without her father&rsquo;s consent and
approval.&nbsp; The brother at this time strongly sympathised
with her aspirations, and favoured them.&nbsp; On the
father&rsquo;s arrival in Paris, the design of his daughter was
imparted to him.&nbsp; He was greatly surprised and moved by the
proposition&mdash;pleased, on the one hand, by his
daughter&rsquo;s devotion, and yet deeply wounded by the idea of
parting with her.&nbsp; He took time for consideration, and at
length made up his mind that it was impossible to give his
consent.&nbsp; Not only so, but he strongly blamed his son, who
had broken the matter to him, for encouraging his sister&rsquo;s
design without first ascertaining whether it would be agreeable
to himself, <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and he seems for the time to have
felt so much distrust in them both, that he instructed an old
domestic, who had been with them from their youth, to watch over
their actions.&nbsp; This is the narrative of Madame
P&eacute;rier; <a name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a> and the unpleasantness which arose out
of this event appears also implied in Jacqueline&rsquo;s letter
to her sister in the spring of the same year. <a
name="citation54b"></a><a href="#footnote54b"
class="citation">[54b]</a></p>
<p>In 1649 the Pascal family left Paris for Auvergne, and seem to
have remained there for about a year and a half.&nbsp; Madame
P&eacute;rier says nothing of this visit, so far as her brother
is concerned, beyond the fact that he accompanied Jacqueline and
her father.&nbsp; The likelihood, however, is, that the visit was
in some degree prompted by a regard for Pascal&rsquo;s
health.&nbsp; He had made in Paris some progress towards
recovery, notwithstanding the severity of his treatment.&nbsp;
But he was still far from well, and it was judged necessary,
&ldquo;in order to re-establish him entirely, that he should
abandon every sort of mental occupation, and seek, as much as he
could, opportunities of amusing himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her
brother, she adds, was very reluctant to take this advice,
&ldquo;because he saw its danger.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length,
however, he yielded, &ldquo;considering himself obliged to do all
he could to restore his health, and because he thought that
trivial amusements could not harm him.&nbsp; So he set himself on
the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; When this definite change in
Pascal&rsquo;s life began is left uncertain, but there are
indications that he had largely abandoned his studies in 1649 and
the following year.&nbsp; During these years there is nothing
from his pen.&nbsp; The interval between the
&ldquo;recital&rdquo; of the experiments on the Puy de D&ocirc;me
(1648), and his letter to M. Ribeyre, <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>12th July
1651, is blank in any record of scientific or literary
labour.&nbsp; This is not conclusive, of course, that he was
idle; but taken in connection with the remarks of his sister, and
the retirement to Auvergne, it suggests that the family may have
sought there, in rural isolation and domestic reunion, the means
of entirely withdrawing Pascal from his severer studies, and the
scientific companions who were constantly prompting them in
Paris.&nbsp; It may be, also, that the father sought the means of
withdrawing Jacqueline from the neighbourhood of Port Royal, and
from the equally exciting associations to her connected with that
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Of Pascal&rsquo;s life at this time in Auvergne we know
nothing, or next to nothing.&nbsp; There is, indeed, a single
trace, of which the most has been made, in the Memoirs of
Fl&eacute;chier, describing his stay at Clermont in 1665 and
1666, a few years after Pascal&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; In these
Memoirs, Fl&eacute;chier relates an anecdote of a young lady
&ldquo;who was the Sappho of the country,&rdquo; and greatly
beloved by all the <i>beaux esprits</i> of the time.&nbsp;
Amongst others, &ldquo;M. Pascal, who had then acquired so much
reputation, and another <i>savant</i>, were continually with this
<i>belle savante</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is difficult to know what
to make of this vague if piquant anecdote.&nbsp; Some of
Pascal&rsquo;s more religious admirers have even been scandalised
by it, and have tried to show that it could not refer to the
author of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;&nbsp; M. Cousin and
other parties have emphasised it too much. <a
name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a>&nbsp; There seems no reason to doubt
that the anecdote relates to the younger Pascal&mdash;it cannot
reasonably be supposed to relate to his father.&nbsp; Nor is
there any ground to suppose that Pascal <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>was less
likely to be interested in a beautiful and accomplished
<i>demoiselle</i> than any other young man of his age.&nbsp; On
the contrary, there is some reason to think him at this time
peculiarly susceptible to the charms of female
companionship.&nbsp; The passing glimpse which the story gives of
his occupations in Auvergne, and the comparative brightness and
leisure in which it seems to set his life for a little, are
pleasing.&nbsp; It suggests the idea that the change to the
country had worked successfully, and that with rest and
retirement from Paris his health had greatly benefited.</p>
<p>It is a very different picture we get of the once brilliant
Jacqueline.&nbsp; If her father had cherished any hopes of
restoring her again to the world, he was destined to
disappointment.&nbsp; With her conversion at Rouen, and her
association with M. Singlin and Port Royal, her old life seems
entirely to have died out.&nbsp; Even her old pleasure in making
verses was renounced at the bidding of Port Royal.&nbsp; She was
told &ldquo;that it was a talent of which God would not take any
account&mdash;it was necessary to bury it,&rdquo; and this
although she only exerted it now in the service of religion and
the Church.&nbsp; While Madame P&eacute;rier has given us no
details, and, indeed, no facts whatever, of her brother&rsquo;s
life at this time, she has given us a minute picture of
Jacqueline&rsquo;s austerities.&nbsp; In everything save in name
she had already become a nun.&nbsp; She wore a dress approaching
as nearly as possible to a religious habit; she fasted and kept
vigils; she spent her whole time either in the house alone,
absorbed in religious ecstasy, or abroad in works of active
charity; in every way she made it plainly to be known that it was
only her father&rsquo;s wish that kept her in the world at
all.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>After a stay in Auvergne of seventeen months, the family
returned to Paris in November 1650.&nbsp; There we still read of
the pious labours and devotion of Jacqueline&mdash;little or
nothing of her brother.&nbsp; How far the leisure of country life
may have weaned him from his old pursuits, how far the world had
begun to exercise a new attraction over him, we learn
nothing.&nbsp; It is evident from his letter to M. P&eacute;rier
on his father&rsquo;s death, nearly a year after this, that he
still cherished strongly his religious convictions.&nbsp; Yet
there is nothing in all this time to tell of his religious
profession; and Madame P&eacute;rier plainly does not care to
dwell upon it, but hurries forward to the later and more edifying
period of his career.&nbsp; The impression is left upon us that
worldly distractions had already begun to influence his life.</p>
<p>These distractions rapidly acquired force after the
father&rsquo;s death in the autumn of 1651 (September).&nbsp; The
devoted Jacqueline attended his last moments with assiduous
tenderness; but no sooner was the event over than she renewed her
determination to enter Port Royal.&nbsp; The issue cannot be so
well described as in Madame P&eacute;rier&rsquo;s
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Being ill,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I was
unable to leave Paris till the end of November.&nbsp; In this
interval, my brother, who was greatly afflicted, and had received
much consolation from my sister, imagined that her affection
would make her remain with him at least a year. . . .&nbsp; He
spoke to her on the subject, but in such a manner as to convey
the impression that she would not so far contradict him for fear
of redoubling his grief.&nbsp; This led her to dissemble her
intention till our arrival.&nbsp; Then she told me that her
resolution was fixed to adopt a religious life as soon as our
respective shares [of the father&rsquo;s property] were
arranged.&nbsp; She would, <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>however,
spare my brother by leading him to suppose she only meditated a
retreat!&nbsp; With this view, she disposed of everything in my
presence; our shares were settled on the last day of December;
and she fixed upon the 4th of January for carrying out her
decision.&nbsp; On the evening before, she begged me to say
something to my brother, that he might not be taken by
surprise.&nbsp; I did so with all the precaution I could; but
although I hinted that it was only a retreat, with the view of
knowing something of the sort of life, he did not fail to be
deeply touched.&nbsp; He withdrew very sad to his chamber without
seeing my sister, who was then in a small cabinet where she was
accustomed to retire for prayer.&nbsp; She did not come out till
my brother had left, as she feared his look would go to her
heart.&nbsp; I told her for him what words of tenderness he had
spoken; and after that we both retired.&nbsp; Though I consented
with all my heart to what my sister was doing, because I thought
it was for her the highest good, the greatness of her resolution
astonished and occupied my mind so that I could not sleep all
night.&nbsp; At seven o&rsquo;clock, when I saw that my sister
was not up, I concluded that she was no longer sleeping, and
feared that she might be ill.&nbsp; Accordingly, I went to her
bed, where I found her still fast asleep.&nbsp; The noise I made
awoke her; she asked me what o&rsquo;clock it was.&nbsp; I told
her; and having inquired how she was, and if she had slept well,
she said she was very well, and that she had slept
excellently.&nbsp; So she rose, dressed, and went away, doing
this, as everything else, with a tranquillity and equanimity
inconceivable.&nbsp; We said no adieu for fear of breaking
down.&nbsp; I only turned aside when I saw her ready to go.&nbsp;
In this manner she quitted the world on the 4th January 1652,
being then exactly twenty-six years and three months old.&rdquo;

</blockquote>
<p>Our readers will not grudge this extract, so touching in its
simplicity.&nbsp; What a living picture does it give us of this
remarkable family!&mdash;the elder sister&rsquo;s wakeful <!--
page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>anxiety&mdash;the younger&rsquo;s calm
determination&mdash;the brother&rsquo;s half-suppressed yet
deeply-moved tenderness&mdash;the proud and sensitive reserve of
all the three.&nbsp; Jacqueline&rsquo;s firmness was heroic, but
her heart was full of concern.&nbsp; She had escaped the
half-authoritative, half-supplicating entreaties of her brother,
and found refuge for her long-cherished solicitudes of heart in
the bosom of Port Royal, and the strong counsels both of the
M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique and the M&egrave;re
Agn&egrave;s.&nbsp; But after a while this did not satisfy
her.&nbsp; When the time came to make her profession, she was
anxious to do so, not merely with her own consent, but with her
brother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And accordingly, she addressed him in the
following March a remarkable letter, in which, while reminding
him that she was her own mistress to do as she wished in a matter
so seriously affecting her life, she yet prayed him to give her a
kindly greeting in her solemn act, and to come to the ceremony of
her taking the vows.&nbsp; The letter breathes at once the
affection of a sister and the passion of a saint,&mdash;the proud
firmness so characteristic of the family, with a charming
sweetness, blending entreaty with command.&nbsp; She signs
herself already &ldquo;Sister of Sainte Euph&eacute;mie,&rdquo;
the name which she adopted as an inmate of Port Royal, addressing
her brother for the most part with the grave formal
&ldquo;you,&rdquo; but now and then relapsing into the old
familiar &ldquo;thou,&rdquo; as if she were still in the family
home.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Do not take that away,&rdquo; she says, <a
name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a> &ldquo;which you cannot give.&nbsp; If
it is true that the world has preserved some impressions of the
friendship which it showed for me when I was with it, please God
this should not turn me from quitting it, nor you from consenting
to my doing so.&nbsp; This ought rather <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>to be my
glory, and your joy, and that of all my true friends, as showing
the strength of my God, and that it is not the world which quits
me, but I that quit the world, and that the effort which it makes
to retain me is to be regarded as only a visible punishment of
the complacency with which I formerly regarded it, and which it
now pleases God to give me power to resist. . . .&nbsp; Do not
hinder those who do well; and do well yourself; or if you have
not the strength to follow me, at least do not hold me
back.&nbsp; Do not render me ungrateful to God for the grace
which He has given to one whom you love. . . .&nbsp; I wait this
proof of your brotherly friendship, and pray you to come to my
divine betrothal, which will take place, God helping, on Trinity
Sunday.&nbsp; I wrote also to my faithful one [her sister
Gilberte].&nbsp; I beg you to console her, if there is need, and
encourage her.&nbsp; It is only for the sake of form that I ask
you to be present at the ceremony; for I do not believe you have
any thought of failing me.&nbsp; Be assured that I must renounce
you if you do.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of this moving appeal was to bring her brother to
her side.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He came the following day very much put
out,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;with a bad headache, the result of
my letter, yet also very much softened, for instead of the two
years which he had formerly insisted on, he wished me merely to
wait till All Saints&rsquo; Day.&nbsp; But seeing me firm not to
delay, yet willing to give him some further time to think over
the matter, he melted entirely, and expressed pity for the
trouble which had made me delay so long a result which I had so
long and so ardently desired.&nbsp; He did not return at the
appointed time; but M. d&rsquo;Andilly, at my request, had the
goodness to send for him on Saturday, and undertook the matter
with so much warmth, and yet skill, that he consented to
everything we wished.&rdquo; <a name="citation60"></a><a
href="#footnote60" class="citation">[60]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacqueline gained her point so far; but painful <!-- page
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>difficulties still remained, the story of which she
herself has also told us. <a name="citation61"></a><a
href="#footnote61" class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp; While eager to
be admitted to the full privileges of her vocation, she did not
wish to enter Port Royal empty-handed.&nbsp; She thought herself
free to endow it with the share of her father&rsquo;s fortune
which had fallen to her, and seems not to have doubted her
brother&rsquo;s and sister&rsquo;s concurrence in this act of
liberality.&nbsp; But they, on the contrary, were both for a time
deeply offended that she should apparently prefer strangers to
her own kindred.&nbsp; They took the matter &ldquo;in an entirely
secular manner.&rdquo;&nbsp; This greatly grieved her in turn;
and, balked at once in her wishes and her sisterly trust, she
pictures in the most lively colours the distress she
endured.&nbsp; La M&egrave;re Agn&egrave;s consoled her in her
disappointment, and sought to carry her thoughts beyond the mere
chagrin which so obviously mingled with her higher feeling.&nbsp;
Her own somewhat resentful obstinacy gradually yielded to the
pure passivity of resignation&mdash;so strong in its seeming
weakness&mdash;which the sister of Arnauld preached to her.&nbsp;
At length she is content to make no further demands upon her
brother.&nbsp; He and Madame P&eacute;rier shall do as they wish;
the money would not be blessed unless it came from free hearts,
and was given for the love of God.&nbsp; She is willing even to
be received gratuitously as a sister&mdash;a feeling evidently
not without its bitterness.&nbsp; Her submission became, as may
be guessed, her triumph; a result probably not unforeseen by the
deeper experience of La M&egrave;re Agn&egrave;s and M.
Singlin.</p>

in the affair&rdquo;&mdash;at last came to see her, she
endeavoured to meet him as the Mother advised.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,
with all her effort&rdquo; she could not hide the sadness of her
heart.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;was so unlike
my usual manner, that he perceived it at once; and there was no
need of an interpreter to explain the cause, for though I put on
the best face I could, he easily guessed that it was his own
conduct which was the cause of my uneasiness.&nbsp; All the same,
he was desirous of making the first complaint; and then I learned
that both he and my sister felt themselves much aggrieved by what
I had written.&nbsp; He dwelt on this, but could hardly go on,
seeing I made no complaint on my side.&nbsp; Otherwise, I could
have destroyed by a single word all his reasons!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A true family trait!&nbsp; The result of all was, that Pascal
yielded to the tender resignation of his sister what he had
refused to her arguments.&nbsp; He was so &ldquo;touched,&rdquo;
she says, &ldquo;with confusion, that he resolved to put the
whole affair in order,&rdquo; and to undertake himself any risks
or charges that it might involve.</p>
<p>But the heads of the House required to be satisfied, no less
than Jacqueline.&nbsp; They were not disposed to accept any gift
which was not freely and piously given.&nbsp; Accordingly, before
the final disposition of the property was made, La M&egrave;re
Ang&eacute;lique took care that Pascal should understand the
matter anew from the Port-Royalist point of view.&nbsp; St Cyran
had taught them that they were never &ldquo;to receive anything
for the house of God but that which came from God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Even he was not a little surprised, according to the statement of
his sister, at all this scrupulousness&mdash;&ldquo;the manner in
which we deal with such matters;&rdquo; and the men of business
whose <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>presence was necessary on the
occasion are represented as astonished beyond measure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They had never seen business done in such a
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length, however, all was completed.&nbsp;
Pascal professed the genuineness of his motives, and only
regretted that it was not in his power to do more.</p>
<p>If this narrative mainly concerns Jacqueline Pascal, it serves
to throw light upon the character and life of her brother at this
time.&nbsp; In the course of her &ldquo;relation,&rdquo;
Jacqueline, or her interlocutor La M&egrave;re Agn&egrave;s,
makes frequent allusion to Pascal&rsquo;s &ldquo;worldly
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; When she is vexed that he will not carry out
her desires in the matter of the dowry, she is reminded that she
had far more reason to be distressed by the &ldquo;faults and
infidelities&rdquo; into which he had fallen towards God. <a
name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a>&nbsp; He is represented as being so
much engrossed with the vanities and amusements of the world as
to prefer his own pleasure and advantage to the good of a
religious community or the pious gratification of his
sister.&nbsp; It was only by some miracle that it could be
otherwise; and there was no reason to &ldquo;expect a miracle of
grace in a person like him.&rdquo; <a name="citation63b"></a><a
href="#footnote63b" class="citation">[63b]</a>&nbsp; All the
means at his command were hardly sufficient to enable him to live
in the world &ldquo;like others of his condition,&rdquo; and the
associates with whom he was known to be mingling. <a
name="citation63c"></a><a href="#footnote63c"
class="citation">[63c]</a></p>
<p>Plainly at this time Pascal was abandoned by Port Royal.&nbsp;
He had &ldquo;set himself,&rdquo; as his sister briefly says,
&ldquo;on the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; As his niece more particularly
indicates, <a name="citation63d"></a><a href="#footnote63d"
class="citation">[63d]</a> he had given himself up to the
amusements of life.&nbsp; Unable to study, the love of leisure
and of <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>fashionable society had gradually
gained upon him.&nbsp; At first he was moderate in his worldly
enjoyments; but a taste for them insensibly sprang up and carried
him far away from his old associations and the pious severities
of his former life.&nbsp; After his father&rsquo;s death this
change was more clearly marked.&nbsp; He was master of his own
affairs, and he plunged more freely into the pleasures of
society, although always, it is distinctly said, &ldquo;without
any vice or licentiousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this, his niece
adds, was very grievous to her aunt Jacqueline, who grieved in
spirit at seeing him who had been the means of making her learn
the nothingness of the world return to its vanities.</p>
<p>Too much is not to be made of such statements, or the still
stronger expressions of Jacqueline herself in her letters
regarding her brother&rsquo;s final conversion.&nbsp; When she
speaks of &ldquo;wretched attachments&rdquo; binding him to the
world, and of his being still &ldquo;haunted by the smell of the
mud which he had embraced with such <i>empressement</i>,&rdquo;
<a name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a> we are to remember that she speaks not
only out of the severity of her own youthful judgment, (and what
judgment is so severe at times as that of youth?) but out of the
mouth of Port Royal.&nbsp; She condemns a world which was no
doubt bad enough, but of which she knew nothing.&nbsp; Her
allusions to the &ldquo;grandeur&rdquo; of her brother&rsquo;s
life and similar indications have led Sainte-Beuve and others to
speak of his extravagance at this time.&nbsp; He is supposed not
only to have lived in the world, but to have lived in a style
above his means&mdash;the companion of men of higher social
position than himself, profuse in their habits and
expenditure.&nbsp; <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>That he lived in the midst of society
of this kind can hardly be doubted.&nbsp; It is more doubtful how
far his own habits had become those of an extravagant man of the
world.&nbsp; His chief companion was one who remained bound to
him through all the rest of his life, Pascal&rsquo;s influence
having drawn him also from the world when the time of his own
change came.&nbsp; This was the Duc de Roannez, a young man of
fewer years than himself, who seems to have possessed many
attractive qualities.&nbsp; He was devoted to Pascal&mdash;could
hardly &ldquo;bear him out of his sight,&rdquo; as Marguerite
P&eacute;rier says&mdash;and Pascal warmly returned his
friendship.&nbsp; It seems as if they had lived together a good
deal, or at least that Pascal spent the most of his time with the
young Duke; and it was in his house and society no doubt that he
tasted the joys and perils of that fashionable and luxurious life
of which his sister speaks so bitterly. <a
name="citation65a"></a><a href="#footnote65a"
class="citation">[65a]</a>&nbsp; It was a life, after all, of
thoughtless enjoyment rather than of any deeper folly.&nbsp; Both
men were as yet very young&mdash;the Duke only twenty-two years
of age, and Pascal twenty-eight.&nbsp; After his simple and
severe training, and the society of his Jansenist friends, it
must have been a change full of excitement, possibly of moral
danger, to the once enthusiastic student; for the society of the
time was charged with the elements both of sceptical and moral
indifference.&nbsp; It has been even said that &ldquo;no society
was ever more grandly dissolute&rdquo; than that of the Fronde,
&ldquo;when women like La Barette <a name="citation65b"></a><a
href="#footnote65b" class="citation">[65b]</a> <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>and La
Couronne took the lead in the least discreet
pleasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the men whom Pascal evidently met at the hotel of the
Duc de Roannez, and with whom he formed something of a
friendship, was the well-known Chevalier de M&eacute;r&eacute;,
whom we know best as a tutor of Madame de Maintenon, and whose
graceful but flippant letters still survive as a picture of the
time.&nbsp; He was a gambler and libertine, yet with some
tincture of science and professed interest in its progress.&nbsp;
In his correspondence there is a letter to Pascal, in which he
makes free in a somewhat ridiculous manner with the young
geometrician already so distinguished.&nbsp; Other names still
less reputable&mdash;those of Miton and Desbarreaux, for
example&mdash;have been associated with Pascal during this
period.&nbsp; Miton was undoubtedly an intimate ally of De
M&eacute;r&eacute;, and amidst all his dissoluteness, made
pretensions to scientific knowledge and attainments as a
writer.&nbsp; Desbarreaux was a companion of both, but of a still
lower grade&mdash;a man of open profligacy, and a despiser of the
rites of the Church.&nbsp; Along with Miton and other boon
companions, he is spoken of as betaking himself to St Cloud for
carnival during the Holy Week. <a name="citation66"></a><a
href="#footnote66" class="citation">[66]</a>&nbsp; The truth
would seem to be that all these men came across Pascal&rsquo;s
path at this time, and were more or less known to him.&nbsp; His
allusions to both Miton and Desbarreaux in the Pens&eacute;es
imply this.&nbsp; There is a certain familiarity of knowledge
indicated in the very <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>heartiness with which he assails
them&mdash;speaking of Miton as &ldquo;hateful,&rdquo; <a
name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a> and of Desbarreaux as having renounced
reason and made himself a &ldquo;brute.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="citation67b"></a><a href="#footnote67b"
class="citation">[67b]</a>&nbsp; But it is against all
probability, no less than against all the facts known to us, to
suppose that Pascal had more connection with such men than
meeting them in the society in which he moved during these years,
and becoming well acquainted with the intellectual and moral
atmosphere which they breathed.&nbsp; It may be too much to say,
with Faug&egrave;re, that he was then consciously imbibing the
experience to be afterwards utilised in his great work, or that
it was the principles professed by these men which gave him the
first idea of such a work; but we may certainly say that the
knowledge of them, as well as all the knowledge he acquired at
this time, served to deepen and extend his moral intuitions, and
to give a finer point to many of his Thoughts.&nbsp; And no
student of Pascal can doubt that &ldquo;if his feet touched for a
moment the dirt of this dissolute society, his divine wings
remained unsoiled.&rdquo; <a name="citation67c"></a><a
href="#footnote67c" class="citation">[67c]</a></p>
<p>A more interesting point than any, however, still remains in
connection with this period of his life.&nbsp; It was now, or
soon after, that Pascal must have composed the &ldquo;Discours
sur les Passions de l&rsquo;Amour,&rdquo; one of the most
exquisite fragments which have come from his
pen,&mdash;remarkable both in itself and in the circumstances of
its discovery by M. Cousin about thirty years ago.&nbsp; M.
Cousin has himself related these circumstances in minute detail,
and with a certain self-elation. <a name="citation67d"></a><a
href="#footnote67d" class="citation">[67d]</a>&nbsp; According to
M. Faug&egrave;re, there was no particular difficulty, <!-- page
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>and
therefore no particular merit, in the discovery.&nbsp; The
fragment was clearly indexed in a catalogue of the Pascal MSS. in
the well-known State library of Paris as follows: &ldquo;Discours
sur les Passions de l&rsquo;Amour, par M. Pascal,&rdquo; and
again in the body of the volume the fragment was entitled,
&ldquo;Discours, etc., on l&rsquo;attribue &agrave; M.
Pascal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The genuineness of the fragment seems
admitted on all hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the first line,&rdquo;
says Cousin, &ldquo;I felt Pascal, and my conviction of its
authorship grew as I proceeded&mdash;his ardent and lofty manner,
half thought, half passion, and that speech so fine and grand, an
accent which I would recognise amongst a thousand.&rdquo; <a
name="citation68a"></a><a href="#footnote68a"
class="citation">[68a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The soul and thought of
Pascal,&rdquo; says Faug&egrave;re, &ldquo;shine everywhere in
the pages, steeped in a melancholy at once chaste and
ardent.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="citation68b"></a><a
href="#footnote68b" class="citation">[68b]</a></p>
<p>The following extracts may give some idea of this remarkable
paper.&nbsp; It commences in an abstract, aphoristic manner not
uncommon with Pascal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Man is born to think; he is never a moment
without thinking.&nbsp; But pure thought, which, if it could be
sustained, would make him happy, fatigues and prostrates
him.&nbsp; He could not live a life of mere thought; movement and
action are necessary to him.&nbsp; He must be agitated by the
passions, whose sources he feels deep and strong in his
heart.&nbsp; The passions most characteristic of man, and which
embrace most others, are love and ambition.&nbsp; They have no
affinity, yet they are often united; together, they tend to
weaken if not destroy each other.&nbsp; For however grand the
human spirit, it is only capable at once of one great
passion.&nbsp; When love and ambition meet, each therefore falls
short of what it would otherwise be.&nbsp; Age determines neither
the beginning nor the end of these two passions.&nbsp; They are
born with the first years, they continue often to the
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>&ldquo;Man finds no full scope for love in himself, yet
he loves.&nbsp; It is necessary, therefore, for him to seek an
object of love elsewhere.&nbsp; This he can only find in
beauty.&nbsp; But as he himself is the most beautiful creature
that God has made, he must find in himself the type of that
beauty which he seeks elsewhere.&nbsp; This defines and embodies
itself in the difference of sex.&nbsp; A woman is the highest
form of beauty.&nbsp; Endowed with mind, she is its living and
marvellous personation.&nbsp; If a beautiful woman wishes to
please, she will always succeed.&nbsp; The fascinations of beauty
in such a case never fail to captivate, whatever man may do to
resist them.&nbsp; There is a spot in every heart which they
reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is of no age; it is always being born.&nbsp; The
poets tell us so, and hence we represent it as a child.&nbsp; It
creates intelligence, and feeds upon intelligence. . . .&nbsp; We
exhaust our power of gratifying it every day, and yet every day
it is necessary to renew its gratification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man in solitude is an incomplete being; he needs
companionship for happiness.&nbsp; He seeks this commonly in a
like condition with his own, because habits of desire and
opportunity in such a case are most readily found by him.&nbsp;
But <i>sometimes he fixes his affections on an object far beyond
his rank</i>, and the flame burns the more intensely that he is
forced to conceal it in his own bosom.&nbsp; When we love one of
elevated condition, ambition may at first coexist with
affection.&nbsp; But love soon becomes the master.&nbsp; It is a
tyrant which suffers no rival; it must reign alone.&nbsp; Every
other emotion must subserve and obey its dictates.&nbsp; A high
attachment fills the heart more completely than a common and
equal one.&nbsp; Small things are carried away in the great
capacity of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pleasure of loving, without daring to say anything
of one&rsquo;s love, has its pains, but also its
sweetnesses.&nbsp; With what transport do we regulate all our
actions with the view of pleasing one whom we infinitely value! .
. .&nbsp; The fulness of love sometimes languishes, receiving no
succour from the beloved object.&nbsp; Then we fall into misery;
and hostile passions, lying in wait for the heart, tear it in a
thousand pieces.&nbsp; But anon a ray of hope&mdash;the very
least it may be&mdash;raises us <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>as high as
ever.&nbsp; Sometimes this comes from mere dalliance, but
sometimes also from an honest pity.&nbsp; How happy such a moment
when it comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first effect of love is to inspire a great
respect.&nbsp; We revere whom we really love.&nbsp; This is
right, and we know nothing in the world so grand as this. . .
.&nbsp; In love we forget fortune, parents, friends, and the
reason of this is that we imagine we need nothing else than the
object of our love.&nbsp; The heart is full; there is no room for
care nor disquietude.&nbsp; Passion is then necessarily in
excess; there is a plenitude in it which resists the commencement
of reflection.&nbsp; Yet love and reason are not to be opposed,
and love has always reason with it, although it implies a
precipitation of thought which carries us away without due
examination.&nbsp; Otherwise we should be very disagreeable
machines.&nbsp; Do not exclude reason from love, therefore; they
are truly inseparable.&nbsp; The poets are wrong in representing
love as blind.&nbsp; It is necessary to take away his veil, and
give him henceforth the joy of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not merely the result of custom, but a dictate of
nature, that man should make the first advances in love. . .
.&nbsp; Great souls require an inundation of passion to disturb
and fill them; but when they begin to love, they love supremely.
. . .&nbsp; When we are away from the object of our love we
resolve to do and say many things, but when we are present we
hesitate.&nbsp; The explanation is, that at a distance the reason
is undisturbed, but in presence of the beloved object it is
strangely moved.&nbsp; In love we fear to hazard lest we lose
all.&nbsp; It is necessary to advance, yet who can tell to what
point?&nbsp; We tremble always till we reach this point, and yet
prudence does not help us to keep it when we have found it. . .
.&nbsp; There is nothing so embarrassing as to be in love, and
see something in our favour without daring to believe in
it.&nbsp; Hope and fear rage within us, and the last too often
triumphs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question arises, What interpretation are we to put on
these chaste yet glowing sentences?&nbsp; It seems hardly <!--
page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>possible to believe that they were not penned out of
some real experience.&nbsp; Pascal was not the man to busy
himself in writing an imaginary essay on such a subject.&nbsp;
Nothing can be conceived less like the sketch of a mere moral
analyst standing outside the passion he describes.&nbsp; There
may be a tendency here and there to over-analysis, and to the
balancing of antitheses now on one side and now on the other; but
there is the breath of true passion all through the piece, and
touching, as with fire, many of its many fine utterances.&nbsp;
Who was then, conceivably, the object of Pascal&rsquo;s
affections?&nbsp; We have it on the authority of his niece that
at this time, when he lived so much as the companion of the Duc
de Roannez, he contemplated marrying and settling in the world.
<a name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a>&nbsp; This, and the indications of the
piece itself, have led to the conjecture that he was in love with
the sister of his friend.&nbsp; Charlotte Gouffier de Roannez was
then about sixteen years of age, endowed with captivating graces
of form and manner, animated by a sweet intelligence and by that
charm of spiritual sympathy so likely to prove attractive to a
man like Pascal.&nbsp; Occupying rooms in the house of his
friend, who, we have seen, could not bear him out of his sight,
Pascal and Mademoiselle de Roannez were necessarily much in each
other&rsquo;s society.&nbsp; What so natural as that he should
fall in love, and overlooking all disparity of rank, cherish the
secret hope of a union with one so gifted and beautiful?&mdash;or
why may not ambition have mingled with his love, as he himself
implies, and carried him for a time into a dreamland from which
all shadows fell away?</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>It is impossible to do more than form conjectures in
such a matter.&nbsp; To M. Faug&egrave;re nothing seems more
probable.&nbsp; M. Cousin resents the supposition as derogatory
to Pascal, and as utterly inconsistent with the usages of the age
of Louis XIV.&nbsp; But even were it impossible, according to the
usages of the time, that Pascal should have ever married
Mademoiselle de Roannez, this is no proof that he may not have
fallen in love with her.&nbsp; There is much in this paper that
favours the idea, that while Pascal loved deeply he yet never
told his love; and the social obstacles, which for a time may
have seemed to him surmountable, at last may have shut out all
hope from his heart.&nbsp; Many causes might unite to do this,
even supposing his love was returned.&nbsp; It is certain that he
continued the warm friend, not only of the Duc de Roannez, but of
his sister; and in after-years a correspondence was established
betwixt them implying the highest degree of mutual esteem and
confidence.&nbsp; We have only the letters of Pascal; nothing is
known of those of Mademoiselle de Roannez; the rigidity of the
Jansenist copyists have given us only extracts even of the
former.&nbsp; All trace of earthly passion, if it ever existed,
has gone from the pious page in which the Jansenist saint sets
forth his exhortations.&nbsp; Yet it argues no common interest,
that Pascal should pause in the midst of his conflict with the
Jesuits to advise and direct his former companion; and
Faug&egrave;re professes that even before he had read the
&lsquo;Discours&rsquo; he could trace a &ldquo;tender
solicitude&rdquo;&mdash;more than the mere impulse of Christian
charity&mdash;beneath all the grave severity of his religious
phrases.</p>
<p>The fate of Mademoiselle de Roannez was not a <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>happy
one.&nbsp; After vacillating for some time between the cloister
and the world&mdash;obeying the guidance of Pascal, either
directly or through Madame P&eacute;rier, and even passing
through her novitiate at Port Royal with &ldquo;extraordinary
fervour&rdquo;&mdash;she was persuaded to marry and become the
Duchesse de la Feuillade.&nbsp; But her marriage proved
unfortunate.&nbsp; Her children died young; her own health broke
down; she herself at length died under an operation, bequeathing
a legacy to Port Royal, which had remained entwined with all
dearest associations.&nbsp; Whether Pascal and she had loved each
other or not, this sacred Home bound their best thoughts
together, and serves to recall their highest aspirations.</p>
<p>It falls to us now to describe how Port Royal claimed the
heart of Pascal, and called forth the chief activities of his
remaining years.</p>
<h2><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
PORT ROYAL AND PASCAL&rsquo;S LATER YEARS.</h2>
<p>Whatever day-dreams Pascal may have cherished, &ldquo;God
called him,&rdquo; as his sister says, &ldquo;to a great
perfection.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not in his nature to be satisfied
with either the enchantments or the ambitions of the world.&nbsp;
All the while that he mixed in the luxurious society of Paris,
and seemed merely one of its thoughtless throng, there were
throbs within him of a higher life which could not be
stilled.&nbsp; His conscience reproached him continually amidst
all his amusements, and left him uneasy even in the most exulting
moments of the love that filled his heart.&nbsp; This is no
hypothetical picture, but one suggested by himself in
conversation with his sister.&nbsp; She tells us from her retreat
how her brother came to see her, fascinated by the steadfastness
of her faith, in contrast with his own indifference and
vacillation.&nbsp; Formerly it was his zeal which had drawn her
to higher thoughts.&nbsp; Now it is the attraction of her piety
which sways him, and leaves him unhappy amidst all the seductions
of the society in which he mingles.&nbsp; &ldquo;God made use of
my sister,&rdquo; says Madame P&eacute;rier, &ldquo;for the great
design, as <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>He had formerly made use of my
brother, when He desired to withdraw my sister from her
engagements in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The severe Jacqueline tells with unfaltering breath the story
of her brother&rsquo;s spiritual anxieties.&nbsp; She had ceased
herself to have any worldly thoughts.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She led,&rdquo; says Madame P&eacute;rier,
&ldquo;a life so holy, that she edified the whole house: and in
this state it was a special pain to her to see one to whom she
felt herself indebted, under God, for the grace which she
enjoyed, no longer himself in possession of these graces: and as
she saw my brother frequently, she spoke to him often, and
finally with such force and sweetness, that she persuaded him, as
he had at first persuaded her, absolutely to abandon the
world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing to her sister on the 25th of January 1655, she says
that Pascal came to see her at the end of the previous
September.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At this visit he opened himself to me in
such a manner as moved my pity, confessing that in the midst of
his exciting occupations, and of so many things fitted to make
him love the world&mdash;to which we had every reason to think
him strongly attached&mdash;he was yet forcibly moved to quit
all; both by an extreme aversion to its follies and amusements,
and by the continual reproach made by his conscience.&nbsp; He
felt himself detached from his surroundings in such a manner as
he had never felt before, or even approaching to it; yet,
otherwise, he was in such abandonment that there was no movement
in his heart to God.&nbsp; Though he sought Him with all his
power, he felt that it was more his own reason and spirit that
moved him towards what he knew to be best, than any movement of
the Divine Spirit.&nbsp; If he only had the Divine sentiments he
once had, he believed himself, in his present state of
detachment, capable of undertaking <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>everything.&nbsp; It must be, therefore, some wretched
ties <a name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a> which still held him back, and made him
resist the movements of the Divine Spirit.&nbsp; The confession
surprised me as much as it gave me joy; and thenceforth I
conceived hopes that I had never had, and thought I must
communicate with you in order to induce you to pray on his
behalf.&nbsp; If I were to relate all the other visits in detail,
I should be obliged to write a volume; for since then they have
been so frequent and so long, that I was wellnigh engrossed by
them.&nbsp; I confined myself to watching his mood without
attempting unduly to influence him; and gradually I saw him so
growing in grace that I would hardly have known him.&nbsp; I
believe you will have the same difficulty, if God continues His
work; especially in such wonderful humility, submission,
diffidence, self-contempt, and desire to be nothing in the esteem
and memory of men.&nbsp; Such he is at present.&nbsp; God alone
knows what a day will bring forth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, after many visits and struggles with himself,
especially as to his choice of a spiritual guide, he became an
inmate of Port Royal des Granges, under the guidance of M. de
Saci.&nbsp; The questions betwixt him and his sister as to his
selection of a confessor or director are very curious, revealing,
as they do, the quiet self-possessed decision of the one, the
scruples of the other, and the proud self-respect of both.&nbsp;
As to one of Pascal&rsquo;s difficulties, she says, without
misgiving&mdash;&ldquo;I saw clearly that this was only a remnant
of independence hidden in the depth of his heart, which armed
itself with every weapon to ward off a submission which yet in
his state of feeling must be perfect.&rdquo;&nbsp; M. Singlin was
willing to assist the sister with his advice, but was reluctant
<!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>himself, in his weak state of health, to assume full
responsibilities towards the brother.&nbsp; Jacqueline herself
appeared to him the best director her brother could have for the
time; and there is a charming blending of humility and yet
assumption in the manner in which she relates this, and speaks of
&ldquo;our new convert.&rdquo;&nbsp; But finally there is found
in M. de Saci a director &ldquo;with whom he is delighted, for he
comes of a good stock&rdquo; (dont it est tout ravi, aussi est-il
de bonne race).</p>
<p>Pascal first sought retirement in a residence of his own in
the country.&nbsp; It is particularly mentioned amongst the
reasons for his withdrawal from Paris, that the Duc de Roannez,
&ldquo;who engaged him almost entirely,&rdquo; was about to
return there.&nbsp; Unable to find everything to his wish,
however, in his own house, &ldquo;he obtained a chamber or little
cell among the Solitaries of Port Royal,&rdquo; from which he
wrote to his sister with extreme joy that he was lodged and
treated like a prince, &ldquo;according to St Bernard&rsquo;s
judgment of what it was to be a prince.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is still
Jacqueline&rsquo;s pen which reports all this to Madame
P&eacute;rier.&nbsp; She continues in the same letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He joins in every office of the Church from
Prime to Compline, without feeling the slightest inconvenience in
rising at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning; and as if it was the
will of God that he should join fasting to watching, in defiance
of all the medical prescriptions which had forbidden him both the
one and the other, he found that supper disagreed with him, and
was about to give it up.&rdquo; <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the story of Pascal&rsquo;s final conversion and
retirement from the world.&nbsp; Jacqueline&rsquo;s details fill
in the briefer sketch of Madame P&eacute;rier, and both tell the
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>story at first hand.&nbsp; None could have known so well
as they did all the circumstances.&nbsp; It is remarkable,
therefore, that neither of them says anything of the well-known
incident, emphasised by Bossut as the mainly exciting cause of
his great change:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; it is said, &ldquo;in the
month of October 1654, when he went, according to his habit, to
take his drive to the bridge of Neuilly <i>in a carriage and
four</i>, the two leading horses became restive at a part of the
road where there was a parapet, and precipitated themselves into
the Seine.&nbsp; Fortunately, the first strokes of their feet
broke the traces which attached them to the pole, and the
carriage was stayed on the brink of the precipice.&nbsp; The
effect of such a shock on one of Pascal&rsquo;s feeble health may
be imagined.&nbsp; He swooned away, and was only restored with
difficulty, and his nerves were so shattered that long
afterwards, during sleepless nights and during moments of
weakness, he seemed to see a precipice at his bedside, over which
he was on the point of falling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This alarming incident, which comes from nearly contemporary
tradition, no doubt contributed to Pascal&rsquo;s retirement from
the world, and no less probably also a strange vision he had at
this time, to which we shall afterwards advert.&nbsp; But it is
peculiarly interesting to trace the inner history of
Pascal&rsquo;s great change.&nbsp; Evidently, from what his
sister says, his mind had been for some time very ill at ease in
the great world in which he lived.&nbsp; How far this was the
working of his old religious convictions continually renewing
their influence through the conversation of his sister, how far
it was mere weariness and disgust with the frivolities of
fashionable life, and how far it may have been baffled hope and
the disenchantments of a broken dream of love, we cannot clearly
tell.&nbsp; All may have moved him, and brought <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>him to that
strange state of isolation which she describes from his own
account.&nbsp; But plainly the world-weariness preceded the fresh
dawn of divine strength in his heart; and there is a tone of
hopelessness in speaking of his detachment from all the things
surrounding him, which favours the thought that some new and
unwonted smart had entered into his life, and driven him forth to
the quiet shelter, where at length he found his old peace with
God, and the great mission to which God had called him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The monastery of Port Royal, in which his sister had already
found a home, remains indelibly associated with Pascal.&nbsp; It
was founded in the beginning of the thirteenth century, in the
reign of Philip Augustus; and a later tradition claimed this
magnificent monarch as the author of its foundation and of its
name.&nbsp; It is said that one day he wandered into the famous
valley during the chase, and became lost in its woods, when he
was at length discovered near to an ancient chapel of St
Lawrence, which was much frequented by the devout of the
neighbourhood, and that, grateful because the place had been to
him a Port Royal or royal refuge, he resolved to build a church
there.&nbsp; But this is the story of a time when, as it has been
said, &ldquo;royal founders were in fashion.&rdquo;&nbsp; More
truly, the name is considered to be derived from the general
designation of the fief or district in which the valley lies,
<i>Porrois</i>&mdash;which, again, is supposed to be a corruption
of <i>Porra</i> or <i>Borra</i>, meaning a marshy and woody
hollow.</p>
<p>The valley of Port Royal presents to this day the same natural
features which attracted the eye of the devout <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>solitary in
the seventeenth century.&nbsp; Some years ago I paid a
long-wished-for visit to it.&nbsp; It lies about eighteen miles
west of Paris, and seven or eight from Versailles, on the road to
Chevreuse.&nbsp; As the traveller approaches it from Versailles,
the long lines of a level and somewhat dreary road, only relieved
by rows of tall poplar-trees, break into a more picturesque
country.&nbsp; An antique mouldering village, with quaint little
church, its grey lichen-marked stones brightened by the warm
sunshine of a September day, and the straggling vines drooping
their pale dusty leaves over the cottage-doors, made a welcome
variety in the monotonous landscape.&nbsp; How hazy yet cheerful
was the brightness in which the poor mean houses seemed to
sleep!&nbsp; After this the road swept down a long declivity,
crowned on one side by an irregular outline of wood, and
presenting here and there broken and dilapidated traces of former
habitations.&nbsp; The famous valley of Port Royal lay before
us.&nbsp; It was a quiet and peaceful yet gloomy scene.&nbsp; The
seclusion was perfect.&nbsp; No hum of cheerful industry
enlivened the desolate space.&nbsp; An air rather as of
long-continued neglect rested on ruined garden and terraces, on
farmhouse and dovecot, and the remains as of a chapel nearer at
hand.&nbsp; The more minutely the eye took in the scene, the more
sad seemed its wasted recesses and the few monuments of its
departed glories.&nbsp; The stillness as of a buried past lay all
about, and it required an effort of imagination to people the
valley with the sacred activities of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>A rough wooden enclosure has been erected on the site of the
high altar surmounted by a cross.&nbsp; It contained a few
memorials, amongst the most touching of <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>which were
simple portraits of Arnauld, Le Maitre, De Saci, Quesnel, Nicole,
Pascal, the M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique, the M&egrave;re
Agn&egrave;s, Jacqueline Pascal, and Dr Hanlon the
physician.&nbsp; Two portraits of the M&egrave;re Agn&egrave;s
particularly impressed me.&nbsp; The lines of the face were
exquisitely touching in their gentle bravery and patience.&nbsp;
As I looked at the noble and sweet countenances grouped on the
bare unadorned walls, the sacred memories of the place rose
vividly before my mind.&nbsp; It was here alone that the recluses
from the neighbouring Grange met the sainted sisterhood, and
mingled with them the prayers and tears of penitence.&nbsp;
Otherwise they dwelt apart, each in diligent privacy, intent on
their works of education or of charity.&nbsp; All the ruin and
decay and somewhat dreary sadness of the scene could not weaken
my sense of the beautiful life of thought and faith and hope and
love that had once breathed there; and never before had I felt so
deeply the enduring reality of the spiritual heroism and
self-sacrifice, the glory of suffering and of goodness, that had
made the spot so memorable.</p>
<p>The monastery was founded, not by Philip Augustus, but by
Matthieu, first Lord of Marli, a younger son of the noble house
of Montmorency.&nbsp; Having formed the design of accompanying
the crusade proclaimed by Innocent III. to the Holy Land, he left
at the disposal of his wife, Mathilde de Garlande, and his
kinsman, the Bishop of Paris, a sum of money to devote to some
pious work in his absence.&nbsp; They agreed to apply it to the
erection of a monastery for nuns in this secluded valley, that
had already acquired a reputation for sanctity in connection with
the old chapel dedicated to St Lawrence, which attracted large
numbers of worshippers.&nbsp; The <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>foundations
of the church and monastery were laid in 1204.&nbsp; They were
designed by the same architect who built the Cathedral of Amiens,
and ere long the graceful and beautiful structures were seen
rising in the wilderness.&nbsp; The nuns belonged to the
Cistercian order.&nbsp; Their dress was white woollen, with a
black veil; but afterwards they adopted as their distinctive
badge a large scarlet cross on their white scapulary, as the
symbol of the &ldquo;Institute of the Holy Sacrament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The abbey underwent the usual history of such
institutions.&nbsp; Distinguished at first by the strictness of
its discipline and the piety of its inmates, it became gradually
corrupted with increasing wealth, till, in the end of the
sixteenth century, it had grown notorious for gross and
scandalous abuses.&nbsp; The revenues were squandered in luxury;
the nuns did what they liked; and the extravagances and
dissipations of the world were repeated amidst the solitudes
which had been consecrated to devotion.&nbsp; But at length its
revival arose out of one of the most obvious abuses connected
with it.&nbsp; The patronage of the institution, like that of
others, had been distributed without any regard to the fitness of
the occupants, even to girls of immature age.&nbsp; In this
manner the abbey of Port Royal accidentally fell to the lot of
one who was destined by her ardent piety to breathe a new life
into it, and by her indomitable and lofty genius to give it an
undying reputation.</p>
<p>Jacqueline Marie Arnauld&mdash;better known by her official
name, La M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique&mdash;was appointed abbess
of Port Royal when she was only eight years of age.&nbsp; She was
descended from a distinguished family belonging originally to the
old <i>noblesse</i> of Provence, but <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>which had
migrated to Auvergne and settled there.&nbsp; Of vigorous
healthiness, both mental and physical, the Arnaulds had already
acquired a merited position and name in the annals of
France.&nbsp; In the beginning of the sixteenth century it found
its way to Paris in the person of Antoine Arnauld, Seigneur de la
Mothe, the grandfather of the heroine of Port Royal.&nbsp; M. de
la Mothe, as he was commonly called, was endowed with the
energetic will, and with more than the usual talents, of his
family.&nbsp; He was specially known as
Procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral to Catherine de M&eacute;dicis;
but, as he himself said, he wore &ldquo;a soldier&rsquo;s coat as
well as a lawyer&rsquo;s robe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a Huguenot,
and nearly perished in the Bartholomew massacre.&nbsp; He had
eight sons, every one of whom more or less achieved distinction
in the service of their country; but his second son and namesake
peculiarly inherited his father&rsquo;s legal talents, and became
his successor in the office of
Procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.&nbsp; He more than rivalled his
father&rsquo;s forensic success; and many traditions survive of
his great eloquence, and of the pre-eminent ability with which he
pleaded on behalf of the University of Paris for the expulsion of
the Jesuits from France, under suspicion of having instigated an
attempt on the life of Henri IV. in 1593.&nbsp; This great effort
has been called the &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; of the Arnauld
family against the Jesuit order, which was never forgiven.&nbsp;
His eloquence produced such an impression, that it is said the
judges rose in their seats to listen to his speech, while crowds
assembled at the closed doors of the Court to catch its partial
echoes.&nbsp; And yet, like some other great speeches, it cannot
now be read without weariness.</p>
<p>Antoine Arnauld married the youthful daughter of M. <!-- page
84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>Marion, the Avocat-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, who became a
mother while still only a girl of fifteen, but who grew into a
noble and large-hearted woman, full of deeds of piety and
charity.&nbsp; In all, the couple had twenty children, and felt,
as may be imagined, the pressure of providing for so many.&nbsp;
Out of this pressure came the remarkable lot of two of the
daughters.&nbsp; The benefices of the Church were a fruitful
field of provision, and the avocat-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, the
maternal grandfather of the children, had large ecclesiastical
influence.&nbsp; The result was the appointment not only of one
daughter to the abbey of Port Royal, but also of a younger
sister, Agn&egrave;s, only six years of age, to the abbey of St
Cyr, about six miles distant from Port Royal.&nbsp; Difficulties,
not without reason, were found in obtaining the papal sanction to
such appointments; but these were at last overcome by means, it
is said, more creditable to M. Arnauld&rsquo;s ability than to
his integrity.</p>
<p>At the age of eleven, in the year 1602, Ang&eacute;lique was
installed Abbess of Port Royal.&nbsp; Her sister took the veil at
the age of seven.&nbsp; United in the nursery, they had also
spent some months together at the abbey of St Cyr, in preparation
for their solemn office.&nbsp; They were of marked but very
contrasted characters.&nbsp; The elder inherited the strong will
and dominant energy of her race.&nbsp; As yet, and for some time
afterwards, without any religious bias, she contemplated her
prospects with a quiet and proud consciousness of
responsibility.&nbsp; The younger sister was of a softer and more
submissive nature.&nbsp; She shrank from her high position,
saying that an abbess had to answer to God for the souls of her
nuns, and she was sure that she would have enough to do to take
care of her own.&nbsp; Ang&eacute;lique had no such <!-- page
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>scruples.&nbsp; She was glad to be an abbess, and was
resolved that her nuns should thoroughly do their duty.&nbsp;
These sayings have been preserved in the memoirs of the family,
and are supposed to indicate happily the firm, persistent spirit
and legislative capacity of the one sister, in contrast with the
passive rather than active strength, and milder yet no less
enduring purpose, of the other.</p>
<p>The remarkable story of Ang&eacute;lique&rsquo;s conversion by
the preaching of a Capucin friar in 1608, her strange contest
with her parents which followed, the strengthening impulses in
different directions which her religious life received, first
from the famous St Francis de Sales, and finally, and especially,
from the no less remarkable Abb&eacute; de St Cyran, all belong
to the history of Port Royal, and cannot be detailed here.&nbsp;
It is a touching and beautiful story, which can never lose its
interest.&nbsp; It is only necessary that we draw attention to
the temporary removal of the Abbess with her nuns to Paris in the
year 1635, and to the settlement in the valley, during their
absence from it, of the band of Solitaries whose piety and
genius, no less than the heroic devotion of the sisterhood, have
shed such a glory around it.&nbsp; It was the spiritual influence
of St Cyran which overflowed in this direction.&nbsp; The
religious genius of this remarkable man, of whom we shall speak
more particularly in the next chapter, laid its spell upon the
social life around him, and brought to his feet some of the most
able and distinguished young men of the time.&nbsp; The elder
brother of Ang&eacute;lique and Agn&egrave;s Arnauld, known as M.
d&rsquo;Andilly, was amongst his devoted friends; and it was
through him that St Cyran first became connected with Port
Royal.&nbsp; D&rsquo;Andilly was married, and a courtier&mdash;a
busy man in the political <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>circles of
his day; but he had long bowed before the force of St
Cyran&rsquo;s religious convictions, and finally he too abandoned
the world, and sought the retirement of Port Royal, whither three
of his nephews had preceded him; and a younger and yet more
distinguished brother, the namesake of his father, soon followed
him.&nbsp; It was D&rsquo;Andilly who said of St Cyran, &ldquo;I
was under such obligations to him that I loved him more than
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, St Cyran said of him,
&ldquo;He has not the virtue of a saint or an anchorite, but I
know no man of his condition who is so solidly
virtuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brotherhood of Port Royal had its beginning in 1637 with
the conversion of two of the nephews of D&rsquo;Andilly and the
M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique, children of Arnauld&rsquo;s eldest
daughter, who had married unhappily and been soon separated from
her husband.&nbsp; These grandsons of Arnauld are known as M. le
Maitre and M. de Sercourt, the former of whom, like his
ancestors, had greatly distinguished himself at the bar.&nbsp;
The latter was no less distinguished as a soldier.&nbsp; In the
midst of worldly success, they forsook everything and gave
themselves to a life of religious retirement, in which they were
by-and-by joined by a younger and still more remarkable brother,
known as M. de Saci, trained for the Church, and already
mentioned in connection with Pascal&rsquo;s conversion.&nbsp; He
became Pascal&rsquo;s spiritual director, and held with him the
famous conversation on Epictetus and Montaigne.&nbsp; To the same
group of men belonged Singlin, of whom we have heard so much in
former pages, and Lancelot and Fontaine; above all, Antoine
Arnauld, the youngest of the large Arnauld family, and the most
indefatigable of them all.&nbsp; Singlin was a favourite of St
<!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>Cyran, and his successor in the office of spiritual
director to the monastery, as De Saci was again the successor of
Singlin in the same capacity.&nbsp; He was a man of less ability
and knowledge than many of the others, the son of a wine
merchant, who did not begin his religious studies till a
comparatively late period, but of a very direct and simple
character, and well skilled in the mysteries of the conscience,
which made him a spiritual power in the community.&nbsp; He was
withal of singular humility, and would fain have retired from the
office of Confessor when St Cyran was set at liberty in 1643
after his long imprisonment; but neither then nor afterwards, on
his illustrious friend&rsquo;s death, was he allowed to do
so.&nbsp; St Cyran warned him that he could not fly from the
duties of such a position without incurring the guilt of
disobedience.&nbsp; De Saci seems to have been especially
remarkable for his quiet self-possession and cautious insight
into character.&nbsp; His brother, Le Maitre, brings out in a
curious manner the contrast between his own impetuous character
and the leisurely efficiency of De Saci&rsquo;s temper.&nbsp; As
they sat at their evening meal&mdash;&ldquo;a very modest
collation&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He had hardly begun his supper when mine
was already half digested. . . .&nbsp; Of quick and warm
disposition, I had seen the end of my portion almost as soon as
the beginning; it rapidly disappeared; and as I was thinking of
rising from the table, I saw my brother De Saci, with his usual
coolness and gravity, take a little piece of apple, peel it
quietly, cut it leisurely, and eat it slowly.&nbsp; Then, after
having finished, he rose almost as light as he had sat down,
leaving untouched nearly all his very moderate portion.&nbsp; He
went away as if he were quite satisfied, and even appeared to
grow fat upon fasts.&rdquo; <a name="citation87"></a><a
href="#footnote87" class="citation">[87]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>Claude Lancelot was the schoolmaster of the community,
and represents to us perhaps more fully than any other name its
famous system of education.&nbsp; Fontaine was one of its chief
memoir writers, from whom we derive so much of our knowledge of
the society; while the younger Arnauld, of whom we shall
afterwards speak, Nicole, and the subject of our present sketch,
represent its philosophical and literary activity.</p>
<p>Such was the company to which Pascal joined himself in
1655.&nbsp; They had been settled in divers places,&mdash;at
first, in 1637, when they were still only a few disciples
gathered around St Cyran, in the immediate neighbourhood of Port
Royal de Paris; and then, when driven from this after their great
head&rsquo;s imprisonment, for a short time at a place called
Fert&eacute; Milon; and then, finally, in 1639, at Port Royal des
Champs.&nbsp; Here they made a great change for the better by
their assiduous industry.&nbsp; They drained the marshy valley,
cleared it of its overgrowth of brushwood, and converted it into
a comparatively smiling and salubrious abode.&nbsp; On the return
of the sisterhood from Port Royal de Paris in 1648, the nuns
found the place improved beyond their expectations.&nbsp; The
conventual buildings had been repaired, and the church kept in
good preservation.&nbsp; The bells of the church tower pealed a
welcome; a large concourse of the neighbouring poor assembled in
the courtyard to greet them; while the Solitaries&mdash;one of
their number, a priest, bearing a cross&mdash;waited at the
church door to enter with them, and swell with their voices the
Te Deum with which they celebrated their return.&nbsp; After this
they parted, a few of the brotherhood repairing to a house which
had been taken for them in Paris, <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>but others
retiring to the well-known farm on the hill known as Les
Granges.&nbsp; There was, of course, the strictest seclusion
maintained in the nunnery, as before, and the inmates of Les
Granges were wellnigh as completely severed from it as the
brethren who retired to Paris.</p>
<p>The mode of life of the Solitaries was simple in the highest
degree.&nbsp; They wore no distinctive dress.&nbsp; Their wants
were supplied by the barest necessaries in the shape of lodging
and furniture.&nbsp; From early morning, three A.M., to night,
they were occupied in works of piety, charity, or industry.&nbsp;
They met in the chapel after their private devotions to say
matins and lauds, a service which occupied about an hour and a
half, after which they kissed the earth in token of a common
lowliness, and sought each his own room for a time.&nbsp; The
round of devotion thus commenced was continued with a steady
uniformity,&mdash;Prime at half-past six; Tierces at nine, and
after this a daily Mass; Sexte at eleven; Nones at two; Vespers
at four; and Compline closing the series at a quarter-past seven.
<a name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a>&nbsp; The Gospel and Epistles were read
daily; and sometimes during or after dinner the Lives of the
Saints.&nbsp; They dined together; and a walk thereafter formed
the sole recreation of the day.&nbsp; Two hours in the morning,
and two in the afternoon, were devoted to work in the fields or
in the garden by those who were able for such tasks.&nbsp;
Confession and communion were frequent, but no uniform rule was
enforced.&nbsp; In this, as in fasting and austerities generally,
each recluse was left to his own free will; and, as will be seen
in Pascal&rsquo;s case, <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>there was no need to stimulate the
morbid desire for bodily mortification.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It was in the last month of 1654 that Pascal&rsquo;s final
conversion and adhesion to Port Royal took place.&nbsp; His mind
for some time before had been greatly agitated, as already
explained&mdash;filled with disgust of the world and all its
enjoyments.&nbsp; Then had come the accident at the Bridge of
Neuilly, and about the same time, or a little later, a remarkable
vision or ecstasy which he has himself described, and which has
given rise to a good deal of useless speculation.&nbsp; During
life he never spoke of this matter, unless it may have been to
his confessor; <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a> but after his death two copies of a
brief writing were found upon him,&mdash;the one written on
parchment enclosing the other written on paper, and carefully
stitched into the clothes that he had worn day by day.&nbsp; It
is beyond question that Pascal must have been deeply touched by
the event, whatever may have been its precise nature, the
memorial of which he had thus preserved.&nbsp; The footnote shows
the writing in the original, as printed by M. Faug&egrave;re:
there are some variations in the copies, but it seems most
correctly given as below.&nbsp; It may be translated as

92</span>It is difficult to make much of this document.&nbsp; Are
we to suppose that Pascal, on the 23d of November 1654, thought
he saw a vision, revealing to him the truth of Christianity, and
the vanity of philosophy and the world?&nbsp; Even if Pascal did
this, our estimate of the matter could hardly be much
affected.&nbsp; But there is no evidence that he himself attached
a supernatural character to the incident.&nbsp; He felt, no
doubt, that a real revelation had come to him, that his mind had
been lifted in spiritual ecstasy <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>away from the
love of all that for a time had hid from him the presence of God
and of a higher world.&nbsp; The moment of this blessed
experience had been sacred to him.&nbsp; He had tried to trace it
in these broken characters, and in seasons of doubt or depression
he may have sought to awaken a new fervour of faith and love by
their contemplation.&nbsp; This seems all the natural meaning of
the incident; but, as some have endeavoured to attach to it a
supernatural importance, so others, in whom the idea not only of
the supernatural but of the spiritual only excites contempt, have
tried to give to it a purely superstitious character.&nbsp; It
was Condorcet who first applied to the paper the epithet of
Pascal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Amulette;&rdquo; and L&eacute;lut has
adopted the epithet, and written a volume more or less relating
to it.&nbsp; He supposes the vision to have occurred to Pascal on
the evening of the day when the event at Neuilly had upset his
nervous system&mdash;always easily disturbed&mdash;and brought
before him a frightful picture of his alienation from God, and
the piety of his early manhood.&nbsp; Facts mingled with the
dreams of his excited imagination.&nbsp; He saw the horses
plunging over the precipice, and an abyss seemed to open beside
him&mdash;the abyss of eternity; when, lo! from the depths of the
abyss there appeared a globe of fire (<i>un globe de feu</i>)
encircled with the Cross; and the irresistible impulse was
stirred in him to throw aside the world for ever, and embrace
God,&mdash;&ldquo;Not the God of philosophers or of
savants,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the God of Abraham, of Isaac, of
Jacob&mdash;the God of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; from whom he had been
severed, but from whom he felt he never more would be severed;
abiding in Him in &ldquo;sweet and total renunciation&rdquo; of
all else.&nbsp; The idea, of course, is that <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>Pascal&rsquo;s dream or vision was the result of
physical derangement; and it may be safely granted that if the
reality at all corresponded to L&eacute;lut&rsquo;s imaginary
picture, this is its natural explanation.&nbsp; The story of the
&ldquo;vision&rdquo; and the &ldquo;abyss&rdquo; are thus made,
not without a certain appearance of probability, to fit into one
another, and both into the accident at Neuilly; and a certain
congruity of external and internal alarm is hence given to the
great crisis of Pascal&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Unhappily, however,
there is a lack of evidence regarding the accident itself, <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a> and, still more, the accompanying story
of the abyss seen by Pascal at his side, which must make the
reader cautious who has no theory to support.&nbsp; Voltaire, in
his usual manner, made the most of Pascal&rsquo;s supposed
delusions.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the last years of his life,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;Pascal believed that he had seen an abyss <i>by the
side of his chair</i>,&mdash;need we on that account have the
same fancy?&nbsp; I, too, see an abyss, but it is in the very
things which he believed that he had explained.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
quotes also the authority of Leibnitz for the statement that
Pascal&rsquo;s melancholy had led his intellect astray&mdash;a
result, he adds, not at all wonderful in the case of a man of
such delicate temperament and gloomy imagination.&nbsp; But
Voltaire was not precise here, as in other matters about
Pascal.&nbsp; He understood him too little to be a good judge of
his mental peculiarities.&nbsp; All that Leibnitz really said
was, that Pascal, &ldquo;in <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>wishing to
fathom the depths of religion, had become scrupulous even to
folly.&rdquo; <a name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95"
class="citation">[95]</a></p>
<p>Whatever explanation we may give of the supposed incidents
attending Pascal&rsquo;s conversion, there never was a more
absurd fancy than that Pascal&rsquo;s mind suffered any eclipse
in the great change that came to him.&nbsp; He may have been
credulous, he may have been superstitious.&nbsp; The miracle of
the Holy Thorn may be an evidence of the one, and the unnatural
asceticism of his later years a proof of the other.&nbsp; But to
speak of the author of the &lsquo;Provincial Letters,&rsquo; of
the problems on the Cycloid, and finally of the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; as if his intellect had suffered
from his conversion, is to use words without meaning.&nbsp; All
his noblest writings were the product of his religious
experience, and he never soared so high in intellectual and
literary achievement as when moving on the wings of spiritual
indignation or of spiritual aspiration.</p>
<p>The whole interest of Pascal&rsquo;s life from this period is
concentrated in his writings&mdash;first the
&lsquo;Provincials,&rsquo; and then the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; to which we devote separate
chapters.&nbsp; There was only the interval of a year between his
conversion and the commencement of his great controversy, and
little is known of how he passed his time during this
interval.&nbsp; He seems to have remained chiefly at Port Royal
under the guidance of M. de Saci, and to have felt an unwonted
measure of happiness in his triumph over the world and in the
possession of his own quiet thoughts.&nbsp; We have seen how he
spoke of being treated &ldquo;like a prince,&rdquo; and even his
health seemed to improve, notwithstanding the regularity and
severity of <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>his religious devotions.&nbsp; He
communicated his feelings of elation to his sister, who replied
(19th January 1655) that she was delighted to find him &ldquo;gay
in his solitude,&rdquo; as she never was at his happiness in the
world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Notwithstanding,&rdquo; she adds, &ldquo;I do
not know how M. de Saci adapts himself to so light-hearted a
penitent, who professes to find compensation for the vain joys
and amusements of the world in joys somewhat more reasonable, and
<i>jeux d&rsquo;esprit</i> more allowable, instead of expiating
them by perpetual tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long Pascal&rsquo;s pious elation continued is not said,
nor have we any further details of his religious life at Port
Royal.&nbsp; He never absolutely took up his abode there as one
of the Solitaries, and could therefore say in his sixteenth
Provincial Letter, without more than an innocent equivocation,
that he &ldquo;did not belong to Port Royal.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
still found there, however, in the beginning of the following
year (1655), when the affair of M. Arnauld and the Sorbonne was
approaching its crisis, and the idea of his famous letters was
started in a meeting, to be afterwards mentioned, between him and
Arnauld and Nicole.&nbsp; After this, during the publication of
the &lsquo;Letters,&rsquo; Pascal seems chiefly to have resided
in Paris, probably with a view to the greater facilities he
enjoyed there in prosecuting his assaults upon the Jesuits, which
continued till the spring of 1657.&nbsp; During the following
year he was busy with the great idea of a work in defence of
religion, suggested partly by his own intellectual activity, but
partly also by a special incident at Port Royal which made a
great impression upon him.</p>
<p>This was the famous &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; of the Holy
Thorn.&nbsp; Madame P&eacute;rier&rsquo;s daughter, Marguerite
P&eacute;rier&mdash;the same <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>to whom we
are indebted for interesting memorials of her uncle&rsquo;s
life&mdash;had become, with her sister, a pupil at Port
Royal.&nbsp; She suffered from an apparently incurable disease of
the eye, <i>fistula lachrymalis</i>.&nbsp; On a sudden she was
reported to be entirely cured, and the cure was attributed to the
touch of a relic which had been brought to the abbey by a
priest,&mdash;a supposed thorn from the crown of Christ.&nbsp; It
is remarkable that the M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique was somewhat
slow of belief as to the &ldquo;miracle,&rdquo; and that she
marvelled the world should make so much of it.&nbsp; But it
secured the credence of Pascal, and became a great fact in the
history of Port Royal, staying for a time the hand of
persecution, and pointing, as its friends believed, to the
visible interposition of heaven.&nbsp; How could the accusations
against Port Royal be true, seeing what God Himself had done on
its behalf?&nbsp; &ldquo;This place, which men say is the
devil&rsquo;s temple, God makes His house.&nbsp; Men declare that
its children must be taken out of it, and God heals them
there.&nbsp; They are threatened with all the furies; God loads
them with His favours.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was Pascal&rsquo;s own
language on the subject, <a name="citation97"></a><a
href="#footnote97" class="citation">[97]</a> and there can be no
doubt that the supposed miracle deeply affected him.&nbsp; He was
&ldquo;sensibly touched,&rdquo; it is said, &ldquo;by such a
grace, regarding it as virtually done to himself, seeing it was
done to one so near to him in kindred, and who was his spiritual
daughter in baptism.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was penetrated by a great
joy, and much occupied by the thought of what had happened, and
the general subject of miracles.&nbsp; There was in this manner
awakened in him &ldquo;the extreme desire of employing himself on
a work in refutation of the principles and false <!-- page
98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>reasonings of the atheists.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He had
studied them,&rdquo; his sister continues, &ldquo;with great
care, and applied his whole mind to search out the means of
convincing them.&nbsp; His last year of work was entirely
occupied in collecting divers thoughts on this
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unhappily, in the course of 1658 Pascal&rsquo;s old illness
returned with redoubled severity, and the last four years of his
life became in consequence years of great languor and
interruption of his projected work.&nbsp; The practice of
continuous composition failed him.&nbsp; Hitherto he had been
wont to develop his thoughts completely,&mdash;to write them out,
as it were, mentally before committing them to paper; but now he
began the habit of transferring his ideas rapidly, and sometimes
imperfectly, to manuscript, as they arose in his mind.&nbsp; In
many cases, if not in all, these first sketches remained as
originally made, without any revision or further reconstruction;
and from the mass of papers accumulated in this manner during
these years the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; were
formed&mdash;the story of whose publication will be afterwards
told.&nbsp; Strangely, it was in this very year, during a fit of
severe toothache, apparently connected with his general illness,
that Pascal began his wonderful series of problems on the
cycloid, showing how fresh and unimpaired his scientific genius
remained under all the changes of his health and of his main
intellectual interests.</p>
<p>The last years of Pascal&rsquo;s life, in their deep
suffering, and in their many traits of pious resignation and
self-denial, have been fully sketched by Madame
P&eacute;rier.&nbsp; We do not think it necessary to repeat the
sketch here, touching and beautiful as in some respects it
is.&nbsp; It is impossible to read her simple and earnest
narrative <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>without emotion, and yet the emotion
is apt to evaporate in translation.&nbsp; It is impossible, also,
to avoid the feeling that, with all the tenderness and humility
of Pascal&rsquo;s later years, there mingle a strange pride in
his very austerities, and something of the nature of religious
mania, which, beautiful as may be the forms it sometimes takes,
is yet in its spirit, and in not a few of its excesses,
essentially unlovely.&nbsp; Pascal&rsquo;s care of the poor, his
love of them&mdash;&ldquo;to serve the poor in a spirit of
poverty&rdquo; was what appeared to him &ldquo;most agreeable to
God&rdquo;&mdash;his wish to die among them, to be carried to the
Hospital for Incurables, and breathe his last there; the story of
his rescue of the poor girl who asked alms from him on the
streets; his unparalleled patience, and even gladness, in
suffering, so that he seemed to welcome it and bind it about him
as a garment; his wonderful humility and yet his noble courage at
the last in the matter of the Formulary,&mdash;all this goes to
the heart of the reader.&nbsp; It must be a cold heart that is
not moved by the picture of a great soul striving &ldquo;to
renounce all pleasure and all superfluities,&rdquo;&mdash;to copy
literally, like St Francis, the portrait of his Master.&nbsp; But
here, as everywhere, the human copy falls infinitely short of the
divine Original.&nbsp; There is the loveliness of a true human
life beneath all the picture of suffering presented to us in the
Gospels.&nbsp; All the hues of natural feeling have gone out of
the last years of Pascal.&nbsp; He not only bore
suffering&mdash;he preferred it; and he boldly justified his
preference.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sickness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the
natural state of the Christian; it puts us in the condition in
which we always ought to be.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this spirit he
strove to deaden any sensation of pleasure in his food, in the
attentions of his relatives and <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>friends,
even in his studies.&nbsp; He could not bear to see his sister
caressing her children; there seemed to him harm in even saying
that a woman was beautiful; the married state was a &ldquo;kind
of homicide or rather Deicide.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought it wrong
that any one should find pleasure in attachment to him, for he
&ldquo;was not the final object of any being, and had not
wherewith to satisfy any.&rdquo;&nbsp; So jealous was he of any
surprise of pleasure, of any thought of vanity or complacency in
himself and his work, that he wore a girdle of iron next his
skin, the sharp points of which he pressed closely when he
thought himself in any danger, especially in such moments of
intercourse with the world as he still sometimes allowed
himself.</p>
<p>Such details are neither interesting in themselves nor do they
present Pascal in his highest character.&nbsp; One cannot help
feeling that, touching as Madame P&eacute;rier&rsquo;s narrative
is, there must have been, even in the Pascal of later years, more
than she has drawn for us.&nbsp; One glimpse we get, but not in
her pages, of a more natural temper, when he withstood his
Jansenist friends in the matter of subscribing the Formulary
demanded from the Port Royalists.&nbsp; He had himself previously
been willing to subscribe, with certain restrictions, when his
sister Jacqueline alone stood out in her resistance to what she
deemed a treasonable betrayal of the cause.&nbsp; She signed at
last, but against her conscience, and, so to speak, with her
blood.&nbsp; She died immediately afterwards, the first victim of
the signature, as she has been called, and bequeathing a letter
to her fellow-sufferers on the subject.&nbsp; Whether inspired by
her words or not, Pascal took a firm stand against any further
concessions, and in a famous <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>interview
with Arnauld, Nicole, and Sainte-Marthe, he argued the point with
such strength and vehemence that he fell fainting to the ground.
<a name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a></p>
<p>This was in the end of 1661, when his sufferings were fast
drawing to a close.&nbsp; In the previous summer, when at
Clermont, he had written to Fermat that he was so weak as to be
&ldquo;unable to walk without a stick, or to hold himself on
horseback.&rdquo;&nbsp; His weakness had grown apace, and in June
1662 he was seized with his last illness.&nbsp; It was necessary
that his sister should nurse him, and this could only be done by
his removal to her house, for he had given up his own house to a
poor family, one of whose children had taken smallpox, and he
would allow neither the child to be removed nor his sister to run
the risk of carrying infection to her children.&nbsp; He left his
own home for hers, therefore, on the 27th of June, and never
returned.&nbsp; Three days after his removal he was seized with a
violent colic, which deprived him of all sleep.&nbsp; His
physicians at first were not alarmed, as his pulse continued
good, but gradually pain and sleeplessness wore him out.&nbsp; He
confessed both to the <i>cur&eacute;</i> of the parish and to his
friend Sainte-Marthe, one of the directors of the
community.&nbsp; He wished, as we said, to die in the Hospital
for Incurables amongst the poor, but in his state of weakness it
was impossible to gratify this wish.&nbsp; After the
administration of the last sacrament, which he received with
tearful emotion, he thanked the <i>cur&eacute;</i>, and
exclaimed, &ldquo;May God never leave me!&rdquo;&nbsp; These were
his last words.&nbsp; Convulsions having returned, he expired on
the 19th of August 1662.</p>
<p><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>It is unnecessary to attempt any estimate of
Pascal&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; The reader must draw it for
himself in the light of these pages.&nbsp; With all enthusiasm
for its grandeur and unity of purpose, and that moral and
intellectual elevation which it everywhere shows, it may be found
lacking in breadth and variety, and that familiar interest and
charm which strangely often come from the contemplation of human
weakness rather than of human strength.&nbsp; There is certainly
less to love in him than to admire&mdash;less to call forth
delight than respect.&nbsp; The play of natural individuality is
hidden behind lines of lofty distance, and latterly of Jansenist
severity.&nbsp; A proud, ascetic, and worn figure seems to rise
before us; but strangely Pascal&rsquo;s portrait, as known to us,
conveys no idea of asceticism.&nbsp; The face is full-fleshed and
expressive, like the face of a child, with large ripe lips and
open eyes of wonder,&mdash;a portrait which suggests the
companion of the Duc de Roannez in his years of pleasure, rather
than the weary and pain-worn penitent of Port Royal. <a

THE &lsquo;PROVINCIAL LETTERS.&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s &lsquo;Letters to a Provincial&rsquo; represent
a great controversy, the nature of which it is necessary to
explain.&nbsp; They are, at the same time, the most perfect
expression of his literary genius, and touch theological
questions with such an inimitable grace and felicity of
expression as to have awakened a universal intellectual
interest.&nbsp; It may be hard to justify this interest by any
analysis of their contents, or by such extracts as can be given
from them.&nbsp; No English can convey the exquisite fitness of
French polemical expression in its highest form, its mingled
force and delicacy, its keenness and yet its lightness.&nbsp; We
shall, however, endeavour to give as clearly as we can an
account, first, of the controversy out of which the
&lsquo;Letters&rsquo; originated, and then of the consummate
skill with which Pascal conducted it.</p>
<p>M. de St Cyran is not merely one of the chief figures
connected with Port Royal: he was the fountain-head of its
special power.&nbsp; To his influence and teaching it was
indebted for its chief glory and its most terrible
sufferings.&nbsp; Jean Baptist du Vergier d&rsquo;Hauranne,
better known by the above official designation, was of noble <!--
page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>family.&nbsp; He was born at Bayonne in 1581, and early
devoted himself to the study of theology at Louvain and
Paris.&nbsp; While a student, he is supposed to have first made
the acquaintance of Cornelius Jansen, and to have begun with him
that co-operation which was destined to bear such remarkable
fruits.&nbsp; Their intimacy was one based on spiritual affinity
and a common enthusiasm.&nbsp; For Jansen was the son of poor
peasants, without even a surname.&nbsp; His father is only known
as Jan Ottosen, or John the son of Otto; as the son in his turn
was Cornelius Jansen, or the son of John.&nbsp; Jansen was the
younger of the two friends, having been born in 1585; but he
appears to have exercised a powerful influence over his older
companion.&nbsp; The great bond of their union and common
enthusiasm was the study of St Augustine.&nbsp; For the purpose
of pursuing this study undisturbed, they retired to the seaside
near Bayonne, and here they established themselves in scholastic
seclusion.&nbsp; Smitten with the desire of attaining theological
truth, they found the Schoolmen constantly appealing to St
Augustine as their authority, and they consequently resolved to
examine this authority for themselves, and so ascend to what they
believed to be the source of their favourite science.&nbsp; Had
they taken only one step further, they would have approached
Protestantism; and as it was, the favourite charge which the
Jesuits afterwards made against them was, that they were
Calvinists in disguise.&nbsp; Unconsciously they were so,
notwithstanding all their disclaimers.&nbsp; The Jesuits were
unscrupulous; but their penetration here, as in many other cases,
was not at fault.&nbsp; The doctrines so warmly espoused by
Jansen and St Cyran were the old doctrines of <i>grace</i>, which
Calvin <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>and they alike borrowed from St
Augustine, and he in his turn found in the Epistles of St Paul.
<a name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105"
class="citation">[105]</a>&nbsp; And the controversy which their
labours were destined once more to awaken in the bosom of the
Catholic Church was nothing else than the old dispute which,
since the days of Augustine and Pelagius, had more than once
already agitated it.</p>
<p>The fellow-students continued their studies near Bayonne for
five years.&nbsp; So closely did they work, that Jansen is said
to have spent days and nights in the same chair, snatching only
brief intervals of rest.&nbsp; A game at battledore and
shuttlecock occasionally relieved their vigils; but no serious
employment divided their attention with the arduous task upon
which they had entered, of mastering and digesting the principles
of the Augustinian theology.&nbsp; The Bishop of Bayonne offered
preferment to D&rsquo;Hauranne, and there were projects of
settling Jansen also at the head of a college; but it was not
till some time afterwards that either of them entered upon
official labours.&nbsp; They were left during those years to the
uninterrupted studies which subsequently resulted in the great
work of Jansen.&nbsp; The system of theological thought
associated with his name was then definitely matured.</p>
<p>It is beyond our province to sketch the career of these
fellow-students, one of whom became the chief spiritual director
of Port Royal, and the other its great theological <!-- page
106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>centre.&nbsp; The abbey of St Cyran was the only
preferment which D&rsquo;Hauranne ever accepted, notwithstanding
Richelieu&rsquo;s repeated offers of a bishopric.&nbsp; He was
content to exercise from his monastic seclusion an influence far
more powerful than that of any bishop of his day.&nbsp; And so
penetrating and dangerous did this influence seem to the great
Minister whose efforts to bind him to his side had so often
failed, that he at length shut him up in Vincennes (May
1638).&nbsp; Here he remained in close confinement for more than
four years; but even from this gloomy retreat the impression of
his great personal power was spread abroad, and felt in many
quarters as steadily as before.&nbsp; He survived his release
only a few months.&nbsp; His long imprisonment had broken down
his health; and although the enthusiasm of his spirit was strong
as ever, his weakened body was no longer able to answer to its
demands.&nbsp; He could hardly &ldquo;hold himself up,&rdquo; and
a slight attack of illness carried him off.</p>
<p>St Cyran&rsquo;s chief strength seems to have lain in a
concentrated enthusiasm and quiet strength of will which enabled
him to hold his own against all opposition, and to subdue other
minds larger than his own to his purposes.&nbsp; When the Prince
de Cond&eacute; interceded for him after his arrest,
Richelieu&rsquo;s reply was: &ldquo;Do you know of whom you are
speaking?&nbsp; That man is more dangerous than six armies.&nbsp;
<i>I</i> say that attrition with confession is necessary:
<i>he</i> believes that contrition is necessary. <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a>&nbsp; And in the affair of
Monsieur&rsquo;s marriage all France has given way to me, and he
alone has the hardihood to <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>oppose
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Against all enticements and assaults alike he
set a proud and firm faith in his own mission&mdash;a patience
sublime in its calmness, and in the unwavering consciousness of
Divine right on his side.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am careful to complain
of nothing,&rdquo; he said in his imprisonment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
ready to remain here a hundred years; to die here, if God
will.&nbsp; I am ready for whatever He designs&mdash;for action
or for suffering.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same faith and quiet assurance
gave him his marvellous influence over others, and that
fascination which made him a power in the cultivated society of
Paris.&nbsp; All the Arnauld family more or less owned his
influence; and it was his teaching mainly that peopled Port Royal
with the Solitaries who have made it so illustrious.</p>
<p>The life and work of Jansen seem at first far removed from
Port Royal.&nbsp; He returned to Louvain after his sojourn at
Bayonne, and became a professor of theology in its famous
university, on whose behalf he was employed in several political
negotiations with the Spanish Court.&nbsp; Finally he was
appointed Bishop of Ypres, in which capacity he is chiefly known
in the ecclesiastical world.&nbsp; His fame, however, rests not
on any political or ecclesiastical labours, but on the results
flowing from his original studies at Bayonne.&nbsp; He never
forgot his devotion to St Augustine.&nbsp; He is said to have
read the whole of his writings ten times, and the treatises
against the Pelagians not less than thirty times.&nbsp; The fruit
of all this studious devotion was his work known briefly as the
&lsquo;Augustinus,&rsquo; <a name="citation107"></a><a
href="#footnote107" class="citation">[107]</a> published two
years after <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>his death (in 1640).&nbsp; Nothing
could have seemed more innocent or laudable than the attempt by a
bishop of the Church to set forth the doctrine of St
Augustine.&nbsp; The book professed to have been undertaken in a
humble spirit.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have avoided error where I could,&rdquo;
says the author; &ldquo;for the cases in which I could not, I
implore the reader&rsquo;s pardon. . . .&nbsp; Let the knowledge
of my sincerity make amends for the simplicity of my error.&nbsp;
I know that if I have erred, it is not in the assertion of
Catholic truth, but in the statement of the opinion of St
Augustine; for I have not laid down what is true or false, what
is to be held or rejected according to the faith of the Catholic
Church, but only what Augustine taught and declared was to be
held.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A task of such a character, carried out in such a spirit,
might have seemed a harmless one.</p>
<p>But the Jesuits had long marked both St Cyran and Jansen as
theological foes, opposed to their special doctrines.&nbsp; They
endeavoured therefore, first of all, to prevent the publication
of Jansen&rsquo;s work; and failing in this, they directed all
their efforts to procure a condemnation of the book from the
Court of Rome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; it has been said,
&ldquo;did any book receive a more stormy welcome.&nbsp; Within a
few weeks of its appearance the University, the Jesuits, the
executors of Jansen, the printer of the &lsquo;Augustinus,&rsquo;
the Spanish governor of the Low Countries, and the Papal Nuncio
were engaged in a warfare of pamphlets, treatises, pasquinades,
pleadings, synods, audiences, which it would be impossible to set
forth in historical sequence.&rdquo; <a name="citation108"></a><a
href="#footnote108" class="citation">[108]</a>&nbsp; In the midst
of all this, Jansen&rsquo;s old fellow-student received the book,
in the <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>preparation of which he also had had
some share, in his prison at Vincennes, as if an echo of his own
thoughts.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would last as long as the
Church,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;After St Paul and St
Augustine, no one had written concerning grace like
Jansen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jesuits were resolved in their hostility.&nbsp; They knew
that the book, while assuming a historical form, and professing
in the main to represent the doctrine of Augustine as directed
against the errorists of his own time, had a side reference to
the &ldquo;opinions of certain modern authors,&rdquo; understood
to be well-known theologians of their own school.&nbsp; This was
in fact acknowledged in an appendix.&nbsp; Unable any longer to
wreak their vengeance on the author himself, they were resolved
to put his work under ban; and accordingly, a Bull was obtained
from Rome in the summer of 1642, condemning Jansen by name, and
declaring that the &lsquo;Augustinus&rsquo; contained &ldquo;many
propositions already condemned&rdquo; by the Holy See.&nbsp; It
was doubted whether the Pope, Urban VIII., designed to go the
length announced in the bull, and the terms of the condemnation
were rumoured to have been inserted by a Papal officer in the
interests of the Jesuits.&nbsp; The Universities of Louvain and
Paris therefore did not take any steps to carry out the
condemnation.&nbsp; They remained spectators of the controversy
which raged around them, in which the Archbishop of Paris on one
side, and the youngest of the Arnauld family on the other, were
conspicuous.</p>
<p>Antoine Arnauld was the last of the twenty children born to
the great parliamentary orator and Catherine Marion his wife, of
whom we have already spoken.&nbsp; His nephews, Le Maitre and De
Saci, were so near his own <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>age, that
they were accustomed to call him familiarly <i>le petit
oncle</i>.&nbsp; Early consecrated to theological studies by the
influence of St Cyran and his mother, he espoused zealously the
Augustinian doctrines.&nbsp; A splendid prospect seemed opening
before him, had he chosen to enter the Church and pursue an
ecclesiastical career in the ordinary manner.&nbsp; But while
thirsting for theological distinction, he had scruples about his
vocation to the holy office.&nbsp; He overcame his scruples so
far as to become a priest; but not only would he not accept the
benefices placed within his reach by powerful friends&mdash;he
insisted on resigning such as he held.&nbsp; He even disposed of
his patrimony for the benefit of Port Royal, preserving only as
much as would provide him with the bare necessaries of
life.&nbsp; He became a doctor in 1641, and already, in 1643, the
interest of the whole theological world was aroused by his
treatise, &lsquo;Of Frequent Communion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The aim of this treatise, as of all Arnauld&rsquo;s writings,
was anti-Jesuitical.&nbsp; He set forth, backed by the authority
of &ldquo;Fathers, Popes, and Councils,&rdquo; the necessity of
spiritual preparation for the Holy Communion, in opposition to
the formula which had been boldly advanced by more than one
Jesuit teacher, that &ldquo;the more we are devoid of divine
grace, the more ought we to seek Jesus Christ in the
Eucharist.&rdquo;&nbsp; The commotion made by the publication
shows how grave was the need for it.&nbsp; On the one hand it was
warmly welcomed, many pious bishops and doctors testifying
approbation of its contents; on the other hand it was violently
assailed.&nbsp; The Jesuit pulpits resounded with abuse of it and
of its author.&nbsp; All Paris was disturbed by the noise which
it made.&nbsp; &ldquo;There <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>must be a
snake in the grass somewhere,&rdquo; it was wittily remarked,
&ldquo;for the Jesuits were never so excited when only the glory
of God was at stake.&rdquo;&nbsp; The learned Petavius, and even
the Prince de Cond&eacute;, did not disdain to mingle in the
combat.&nbsp; For a time Arnauld seemed to triumph, but finally
the influence of Rome was brought against him, and he was glad to
take refuge in concealment&mdash;the first of the many
concealments into which his incessant polemical activity drove
him in the course of his long life.&nbsp; He never abated his
opposition.&nbsp; He had no sooner retired from one controversy,
than he reappeared in some other.&nbsp; His energy knew no
bounds, his love of fighting no pause.&nbsp; When in his old age
his friend and fellow-student Nicole advised him to rest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rest!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;have I not all eternity to
rest in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a matter of course that when the great Jansenist
controversy began, Arnauld should be found in the van of
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;An Apology for Jansen&rsquo; appeared from his
pen in 1644, and a second &lsquo;Apology&rsquo; in the following
year.&nbsp; It seemed for a time as if the Jesuits would be
foiled in their efforts to secure the effectual condemnation of
the book.&nbsp; But at length one of their number, Nicolas
Cornet, Syndic of the Faculty of Theology at Paris, collected its
essential heresy in the shape of seven propositions.&nbsp; These
propositions were afterwards reduced to five; and at length, on
the 31st of May 1653, a formal condemnation of them was obtained
from the Court of Rome.&nbsp; There was no longer any doubt as to
the attitude of the Holy See.&nbsp; All the propositions were
declared to be distinctly heretical, and the first and the fifth,
moreover, to be blasphemous and impious.&nbsp; This result was
not reached without much debate and <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>delay.&nbsp; No sooner had Cornet&rsquo;s propositions
appeared than Arnauld assailed them and all who supported
them.&nbsp; A congregation of four cardinals and eleven
theological assessors had been appointed to examine them in the
end of the year 1651.&nbsp; They had taken, therefore, a year and
a half to their work, and the sentence at length issued was
intended to bring the long warfare to a close.&nbsp; In point of
fact it kindled a fresh fire, and opened, if not a larger, yet a
more vital controversy.&nbsp; Arnauld retired willingly before a
new writer summoned by himself into the field, and girded with
his blessing as he went forth to the encounter.</p>
<p>The five propositions, which were professed to be extracted
from Jansen&rsquo;s book, and as such were condemned by the Papal
Bull of 31st May 1653, are so intimately connected with the
&lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo; as to claim a place in our
pages.&nbsp; They are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I.&nbsp; There are divine commandments which good
men, although willing, are unable to obey; and the grace by which
these commandments are possible is also wanting in them.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; No person, in the state of fallen nature, is able to
resist internal grace.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; In order to render human actions meritorious or
otherwise, liberty from necessity is not required, but only
liberty from constraint.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; The semi-Pelagians, while admitting the necessity of
prevenient grace&mdash;or grace preceding all actions&mdash;were
heretics, inasmuch as they said that this grace was such as man
could, according to his will, either resist or obey.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; The semi-Pelagians also erred in saying that Christ
died or shed His blood for all men universally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>It would be needless for us to touch these
propositions, even by way of explanation.&nbsp; We have
endeavoured to state them from the original Latin as clearly as
we can, so that they may bear some definite meaning even to the
non-theological reader.&nbsp; But their very statement bristles
with controversy, and the half-extinct meanings of old questions
that go to the root of Christian thought lie hid in their
language.&nbsp; All the propositions were condemned without
reserve, but two points were left unsettled.&nbsp; It was not
asserted that the propositions were to be found in the
&lsquo;Augustinus,&rsquo; and that they were condemned in the
sense in which Jansen held them, and in no other.&nbsp; The
course of the controversy and the fate of Port Royal in the end
mainly turned upon these points.</p>
<p>The Papal Bull condemning the five propositions was speedily
published in France, and the triumph of the Jesuits was
undisguised.&nbsp; A great blow had been struck, and for a time
all seemed inclined to bow before it.&nbsp; Political reasons
combined with others to give effect to the Papal verdict.&nbsp;
Cardinal Mazarin, in possession of the favour of the
Queen-mother, had imprisoned his enemy, Cardinal de Retz, who had
so long waged in the intrigues and wars of the Fronde a restless
conflict with them; and as the latter in his prosperity had shown
a certain favour for Port Royal, this was enough to stimulate, on
the part of Mazarin, an interest on behalf of the Jesuits.&nbsp;
Yet he was reluctant to move actively against the
Jansenists.&nbsp; M. d&rsquo;Andilly still had his ear in matters
of State, and by his intervention and that of others the project
of an armistice was for a time entertained.&nbsp; Port Royal was
to keep silence, if its enemies did not push their triumph to an
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>extremity.&nbsp; Even the indefatigable Arnauld seems
to have promised to be quiet.&nbsp; But the Jesuits were too
conscious of their power, and too relentless in their hostility,
to pause in their determination to crush their opponents.&nbsp;
They had recourse both to gibes and to active persecution.&nbsp;
They printed an almanac with the figure of Jansen as
frontispiece, flying in the guise of a winged devil before the
Pope and the king into the arms of the Huguenots.&nbsp; They
assailed the Duc de Liancourt, and refused him absolution in his
own parish church, for no other reason but that he was on
friendly relations with Port Royal, and would not withdraw, at
their demand, his granddaughter from its protection.&nbsp; This
affair, which appears to have been deliberately planned, caused a
great sensation, and became, strangely, the indirect occasion of
the &lsquo;Provincial Letters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indignant at such an outrage, Arnauld was no longer to be
restrained.&nbsp; He rushed before the public with a pamphlet
under the title, &ldquo;Letter of a Doctor of the Sorbonne to a
Person of Condition, concerning an event which has recently
happened in a parish of Paris to a Nobleman of the Court,
February 24, 1655.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Letter opened with an
expression of his wish to dispute no more; but as Sainte-Beuve
hints, the avowed desire of peace plunged him all the more into
war.&nbsp; His letter called forth numerous replies.&nbsp; He
responded by a &ldquo;Second Letter,&rdquo; in the shape of a
volume.&nbsp; In this letter his enemies seemed to see his fate
written.&nbsp; They extracted from it two propositions which in
their view clearly contravened the Papal verdict&mdash;namely,
1st, that he had expressed doubts whether the five propositions
condemned as heretical were in Jansen&rsquo;s book at all; and
2d, that <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>he had really reproduced the first
of the five condemned propositions in one of his own statements,
that according to both the Gospel and the Fathers, St Peter, a
just man, was wanting in grace when he fell.&nbsp; This was
nothing but undisguised Jansenism, and his accusers in the
Sorbonne rallied for his overthrow.&nbsp; A meeting was summoned
to consider the letter, and to judge it and the author.</p>
<p>The details of the proceedings would weary the reader.&nbsp;
It is sufficient to say that, notwithstanding the concessions
wrung from Arnauld, some of which were humiliating enough, he was
condemned on the first point (Jan. 1656)&mdash;the great question
of &ldquo;fait,&rdquo; in contrast to the question of
&ldquo;droit,&rdquo; involved in the second statement as to grace
being wanting to St Peter in his fall.&nbsp; His condemnation,
however, was mainly secured by the introduction of a number of
monks who swelled the majority against him, and the legality of
whose vote was challenged by many members.&nbsp; But, as Pascal
afterwards said, &ldquo;it was easier to find monks than
arguments.&rdquo;&nbsp; The second and doctrinal point received
professedly more deliberate discussion.&nbsp; The sittings
regarding it were protracted till the close of the month, the
29th of January.&nbsp; But the result was really
forestalled.&nbsp; The restriction laid on free debate was such
as to lead no fewer than sixty doctors to withdraw, protesting to
Parliament against the interference with their rights.&nbsp;
Their protest, however, came to nothing.&nbsp; Sentence was
finally passed, against not only Arnauld, but all who adhered to
him or espoused his opinions.&nbsp; The victim, with his usual
adroitness, escaped his pursuers, and went once more into a
concealment which all their vigilance could not penetrate.&nbsp;
Two days after the censure he wrote to one of his nieces,
&ldquo;I am <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>in very close hiding, and by
God&rsquo;s grace without trouble or disquiet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Would you like me to tell you where M. Arnauld is
hidden?&rdquo; inquired a lady of the <i>gendarmes</i> who were
searching her house for traces of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is safely
hidden here,&rdquo; pointing to her heart; &ldquo;arrest him if
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the interval betwixt the first and second judgment
of the Sorbonne that the first of the &lsquo;Provincial
Letters&rsquo; appeared.&nbsp; The story is, <a
name="citation116a"></a><a href="#footnote116a"
class="citation">[116a]</a> that during the course of the process
Arnauld, Nicole, and Pascal, along with M. Vitart, the steward of
the Duc de Luynes (to whom Arnauld&rsquo;s second Letter had been
addressed), and other friends, were met in secrecy at Port Royal
des Champs.&nbsp; Their conversation turned to the pending case,
and the misapprehensions and prejudices which prevailed in the
public mind regarding it.&nbsp; It was felt that some effort
should be made to clear away these prejudices, and to diffuse
right information in a popular form.&nbsp; Arnauld, ever ready
with his pen, was prepared himself to undertake this task; and in
a few days afterwards he read to his friends a long and serious
paper in vindication of his position.&nbsp; But his friends were
not moved as he expected.&nbsp; His pen, powerful in its own
sphere, was not fitted to tell upon the popular mind; and his
audience were too honest to conceal their disappointment.&nbsp;
Arnauld, in his turn, frankly acknowledged the truth forced upon
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see you do not find my paper what you wished,
and I believe you are right,&rdquo; he said; and then, turning
all at once to Pascal, he said, &ldquo;But you, who are young,
who are clever, <a name="citation116b"></a><a
href="#footnote116b" class="citation">[116b]</a> you ought to do
something.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>The effect
was not lost upon Pascal.&nbsp; He divined with his genuine
literary instinct exactly what was required in the circumstances,
although distrusting his power to produce it.&nbsp; He promised,
however, to make an attempt, which his friends might polish and
put in shape as they thought fit.&nbsp; Next day he produced
&ldquo;A Letter written to a Provincial by one of his
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Letter was unanimously pronounced
exactly what was required, and ordered to be printed.&nbsp; It
appeared on the 23d January 1656; and a second followed six days
later.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been happier or more admirably suited for
their purpose than those Letters.&nbsp; They took up the subject
for the first time in a light intelligible to all.&nbsp; They
brought to play upon it not only a penetrating and rapid
intelligence, but a brightness of wit, and a dramatic
creativeness, which made the Sorbonne and its parties, the
Jansenists and their friends, alive before the reader.&nbsp;
Never was the triumph of genius over mere learned labour more
complete.&nbsp; Arnauld, as he listened to them, must have felt
his own thoughts spring up before him into a living shape, hardly
less startling to himself than to his opponents.</p>
<p>Addressing his friend in the country, the author expresses his
surprise at what he has come to learn of the character of the
disputes dividing the Sorbonne:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have been imposed upon,&rdquo; he
says.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was only yesterday that I was
undeceived.&nbsp; Until then I had thought that the disputes of
the Sorbonne were really important, and deeply affected the
interests of religion.&nbsp; The frequent convocation of an
assembly so illustrious as that of the Theological Faculty of
Paris, attended by so many extraordinary and unprecedented
circumstances, induced such high expectations that one could not
help believing the business to <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>be of
extraordinary importance.&nbsp; You will be much surprised,
however, when you learn from this letter the upshot of the grand
demonstration.&nbsp; I can explain the matter in a few words,
having made myself perfectly master of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two questions, he says, were under
examination&mdash;&ldquo;the one a question of fact, the other a
question of right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He explains the question of fact as consisting in the point
whether M. Arnauld was guilty of temerity in expressing his
doubts as to the propositions being in Jansen&rsquo;s book after
the bishops had declared that they were.&nbsp; No fewer than
seventy-one doctors undertook his defence, maintaining that all
that could reasonably be asked of him was to say that &ldquo;he
had not been able to find them, but that if they were in the
book, he condemned them there.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;even went
a step farther, and protested that, after all the search they had
made in the book, they had never stumbled upon these
propositions, and that they had, on the contrary, found
sentiments entirely at variance with them.&nbsp; They then
earnestly begged that if any doctor present had discovered them,
he would have the goodness to point them out; adding that what
was so easy could not be reasonably refused, as that would be the
surest way to silence all objectors, M. Arnauld included.&nbsp;
But this they have always refused to do.&nbsp; So much for the
one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other side are eighty secular doctors, and some
forty mendicant friars, who have condemned M. Arnauld&rsquo;s
proposition, without choosing to examine whether he has spoken
truly or falsely&mdash;who, in fact, have declared that they have
nothing to do with the veracity of his proposition, but simply
with its temerity.&nbsp; Besides these were fifteen who were not
in favour of the censure, and who are called Neutrals.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having thus stated the question of fact, and the <!-- page
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>balance of parties regarding it, Pascal dismisses it at
once, important as it proved in the after-history of Port
Royal.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As to the issue of the question of fact, I
own I give myself very little concern.&nbsp; It does not affect
my conscience in the least whether M. Arnauld is presumptuous or
the reverse; and should I be tempted from curiosity to ascertain
whether these propositions are contained in Jansen, his book is
neither so very scarce nor so very large but that I can read it
all through for my own enlightenment without consulting the
Sorbonne at all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only, while himself hitherto inclined to believe with common
report that the propositions were in Jansen, he was now almost
led to doubt that they were so from the absurd refusal to point
them out.&nbsp; In this respect he fears the censure will do more
harm than good.&nbsp; &ldquo;For, in truth, people have become
sceptical of late, and will not believe things till they see
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the point being in itself so frivolous, he hastens to take
up the question of right, as touching the faith.&nbsp; And here
the play of the dialogue begins:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You and I supposed that the question here
was one involving the deepest principles of grace, as to whether
it is given to all men, or whether it is efficacious of
itself.&nbsp; But truly we were deceived.&nbsp; You must know I
have become a great theologian in a short time, and you will see
the proofs of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He describes, then, how he had made a visit to a doctor of the
Sorbonne, who was his neighbour, and one of the most zealous
opponents of the Jansenists, to inquire into the
controversy.&nbsp; He asked him why the question as to grace
should not be set at rest by a formal decision <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>that
&ldquo;grace is really given to all&rdquo;?&nbsp; But he received
a rude rebuff, and was told that this was not the point.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There were those on his side who held that grace is not
given to all, and even the examiners themselves had declared, in
a full meeting of the Sorbonne, that this opinion was
problematical.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was, in fact, his own view; and
he confirmed it by what he said was a celebrated passage of St
Augustine, &ldquo;We know that grace is not given to all
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was equally unfortunate in his second
inquiry.&nbsp; His neighbour, opposed as he was to Jansenism,
would not condemn the doctrine of efficacious grace.&nbsp; The
doctrine, on the contrary, was quite orthodox, was held by the
Jesuits, and had even been defended by himself in his thesis at
the Sorbonne.&nbsp; The inquirer is confounded, and ventures to
ask then in what M. Arnauld&rsquo;s heresy consisted?&nbsp;
&ldquo;In this,&rdquo; replies his friend, &ldquo;that he does
not acknowledge that the just have the power of obeying the
commandments of God in the way in which we understand
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having got to what he supposes the &ldquo;heart
of the affair,&rdquo; he posts off to a Jansenist acquaintance,
&ldquo;a very decent man notwithstanding.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if he
was puzzled before, he is still more puzzled when he hears the
worthy Jansenist declare that it is no heresy to hold that
&ldquo;all the just have always the power of obeying the Divine
commandments.&rdquo;&nbsp; Confounded by such a reply, he felt
that he had been too plain-spoken with both Jansenist and
Molinist. <a name="citation120"></a><a href="#footnote120"
class="citation">[120]</a>&nbsp; There must be something more in
this dispute than he understood; and if not, there was no reason
why there <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>should not now be peace in the
Church and the Sorbonne.&nbsp; He returned to the Molinist, whom
he had first visited, with this assurance.&nbsp; The Jansenists,
he said, were quite at one with the Jesuits as to the power of
the righteous always to obey the commandments of God.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All very well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
you must be a theologian to see the gist of the matter.&nbsp; The
difference between us is so subtle that we can hardly make it out
ourselves.&nbsp; It is quite beyond <i>your</i>
understanding.&nbsp; Suffice it for you to know that the
Jansenists will indeed say that the just have always the power of
obeying the commandments&mdash;this is not the point in dispute;
but they will not say that this power is <i>proximate</i>.&nbsp;
<i>That</i> is the point.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mystified more than ever by this new and unknown expression,
of which he could get no explanation, the inquirer now returned
to his Jansenist friend to demand of him if he admitted it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you admit the <i>proximate power</i>?&rdquo; was all
that he could say to him.&nbsp; He had charged his memory
carefully with the expression, all the more that he did not
understand it.&nbsp; The Jansenist smiled, and said coldly,
&ldquo;Tell me in what sense you use the expression, and I will
tell you what I believe about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this was just
what he could not do.&nbsp; So he gave the haphazard answer, that
he used it &ldquo;in the sense of the Molinists.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Which of the Molinists?&rdquo; was the rejoinder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All of them together, as being one body, and having one
and the same mind,&rdquo; was the second answer at random: upon
which he is assured he is very ill informed; that the Molinists,
instead of being at one, are hopelessly divided, but that being
united in the design to ruin M. Arnauld, they have all agreed to
use <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>this term, understanding it in
different senses, and so by an apparent agreement to form a
compact body in order to crush him more confidently.</p>
<p>The ingenuous inquirer hesitates to believe in such
wickedness.&nbsp; He professes himself to be animated by a pure
desire of understanding the subject, and asks still that the
mysterious word <i>proximate</i> may be explained to him.&nbsp;
His Jansenist friend professes a willingness to enlighten him,
but says that his explanation would be liable to suspicion.&nbsp;
He must have recourse to those who invented the expression, and
is referred to a M. le Moine, on the one hand, as representing
the Molinists or Jesuits; and a Father Nicolai as representing
the Dominicans or &ldquo;New Thomists.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both of these
were real characters: the former a doctor of the Sorbonne, and a
violent anti-Jansenist, who had written on the subject of grace;
the latter a Dominican, who is said, however, by Nicole to have
abandoned the principles of his order and embraced
Pelagianism.&nbsp; The bewildered seeker after theological
knowledge resorts, not to these worthies themselves, with whom he
professes to have no acquaintance, but to certain disciples of
theirs.&nbsp; In this manner he gets a definition of
&ldquo;proximate power,&rdquo; from which it is apparent that,
while the Jesuits and Dominicans are only agreed in using the
same expression&mdash;the meanings they put into it being
entirely different&mdash;the Jansenists and Dominicans agree in
substance, while only differing in the use of words.&nbsp; The
passage in which the result of his successive interviews is
described is one of the happiest in the letter.&nbsp; On
receiving from the Dominicans, whom he terms
&ldquo;Jacobins,&rdquo; from their association with the Rue de St
Jacques, where the first Dominican convent in Paris <!-- page
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>was erected, an explanation of the doctrine of grace,
he exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Capital!&nbsp; So, according to you, the
Jansenists are Catholics, and M. le Moine a heretic; for the
Jansenists say that the just have the power of praying, but that
further efficacious grace is necessary&mdash;and this is what you
also approve.&nbsp; M. le Moine, however, says that the just may
pray without efficacious grace&mdash;and this you condemn.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; they replied, &lsquo;but M. le Moine calls this
power <i>proximate power</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But what is
this, my father,&rsquo; I exclaimed in turn, &lsquo;but to play
with words&mdash;to say that you agree as to the common terms you
employ, while your sense is quite different?&rsquo;&nbsp; To this
they made no reply; and at this very point the disciple of M. le
Moine, with whom I had consulted, arrived by what seemed to me a
lucky and extraordinary conjuncture.&nbsp; But I afterwards found
that these meetings were not uncommon; that, in fact, they were
continually mixing the one with the other.&nbsp; I addressed
myself immediately to M. le Moine&rsquo;s disciple: &lsquo;I know
one,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;who maintains that the just have
always the power of praying to God, but that nevertheless they
never pray without an efficacious grace which determines them,
and which is not always given by God to all the just.&nbsp; Is
such a one a heretic?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Wait,&rsquo; said my
doctor; &lsquo;you take me by surprise.&nbsp; Come, gently.&nbsp;
<i>Distinguo</i>.&nbsp; If he calls this power <i>proximate
power</i>, he is a Thomist, and yet a Catholic; if not, he is a
Jansenist, and therefore a heretic.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He calls
it,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;neither the one nor the
other.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He is a heretic then,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;ask these good fathers.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was unnecessary to
appeal to them, for already they had assented by a nod of their
heads.&nbsp; But I insisted.&nbsp; &lsquo;He refuses to use the
word <i>proximate</i>, because no one can explain it to
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon one of the fathers was about to give
his definition of the term, when he was interrupted by M. le
Moine&rsquo;s disciple.&nbsp; &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;do you wish to recommence our quarrels?&nbsp; Have we not
agreed never to attempt an explanation of this word
<i>proximate</i>, but to use it on both sides without saying what
it means?&rsquo;&nbsp; And to this the Jacobin assented.&nbsp;
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>I saw at once into their plot, and rising to quit them,
I said, &lsquo;Of a truth, my fathers, this is nothing, I fear,
but a quibble; and whatever may come of your meetings, I venture
to predict that when the censure is passed, peace will not be
restored. . .&nbsp; Surely it is unworthy, both of the Sorbonne
and of theology, to make use of equivocal and captious terms
without giving any explanation of them.&nbsp; Tell me, I entreat
you, for the last time, fathers, what I must believe in order to
be a Catholic?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You must say,&rsquo; they all
cried at once, &lsquo;that all the just have the <i>proximate
power</i>.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; &lsquo;What necessity can there
be,&rsquo; I argued, &lsquo;for using a word which has neither
authority nor definite meaning?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You are an
opinionative fellow,&rsquo; they replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall
use the word, or you are a heretic, and M. Arnauld also; for we
are the majority, and if necessary we can bring the Cordeliers
into the field and carry the day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second Letter, entitled &ldquo;Of Sufficient Grace,&rdquo;
is exactly in the same vein:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Just as I had sealed my last letter,&rdquo;
the writer opens, &ldquo;I received a visit from our old friend,
M. N---, a most fortunate circumstance for the gratification of
my curiosity.&nbsp; For he is thoroughly informed in the
questions of the day, and up to all the secrets of the Jesuits,
at whose houses, including those of the leading men, he is a
constant visitor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using his friend conveniently as an informant, Pascal proceeds
to explain to the Provincial the question of sufficient grace as
betwixt the Jesuits, Jansenists, and Dominicans.&nbsp; The
amusement of the Letter consists in the manner in which he brings
out, as before, the substantial identity in opinion of the
Dominicans and Jansenists, notwithstanding the junction of the
former with the Jesuits to oppress the latter.&nbsp; The Jesuits
hold the old Pelagian doctrine that grace is given to all,
dependent for its efficacy upon the free will of the
recipient.&nbsp; This <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>is with them <i>sufficient
grace</i>.&nbsp; The Jansenists follow St Augustine, and will not
allow any grace to be <i>sufficient</i> which is not also
efficacious.&nbsp; What is the view of the Dominican?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is rather an odd one,&rdquo; he says;
&ldquo;for while they agree with the Jesuits in allowing a
<i>sufficient grace</i> given to all men, they nevertheless hold
that with this grace alone men cannot act, but require further
from God an <i>efficacious grace</i> which determines their will
to action, and which is not given to all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, <i>this grace</i> is <i>sufficient</i> without being
so.&nbsp; It bears the same name as the grace of the Jesuits, but
in reality the Dominican doctrine is that of the Jansenists, that
men require efficacious grace in order to pious action.&nbsp;
What is the meaning of all this jumble of opinion?&nbsp; Simply,
that the Dominicans are too powerful to be quarrelled with.&nbsp;
The Jesuits are content that they should so far use the same
language with them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They do not insist upon their denying the
necessity of efficacious grace.&nbsp; This would be to press them
too far.&nbsp; People should not tyrannise over their friends;
and the Jesuits have really gained enough.&nbsp; But the world is
content with words; and so the name of sufficient grace being
received on all sides, though in different senses, none except
the most subtle theologians can dream that the expression does
not signify the same to the Jacobins and the Jesuits; and the
result will show that the latter are not the greatest
dupes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conclusion becomes the subject of conversational by-play,
similar to that of the first Letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I went straight,&rdquo; adds the writer,
&ldquo;to the Jacobins, at whose door I found a good friend of
mine, a great Jansenist&mdash;for you must know I have friends
amongst all parties&mdash;<!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>who was
inquiring for another father, different from the one I
wanted.&nbsp; But I persuaded him to accompany me, and asked for
one of my New Thomist friends.&nbsp; He was delighted to see me
again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, well,&rsquo; I said to him, &lsquo;it
seems it is not enough that all men have a <i>proximate power</i>
by which they can never act with effect; they must also have a
<i>sufficient grace</i>, with which they can act just as
little.&nbsp; Is not this the opinion of your
school?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the good father,
&lsquo;and I have this very morning been maintaining this in the
Sorbonne.&nbsp; I spoke my full half-hour; and had it not been
for the sand-glass, I bade fair to reverse the unlucky proverb
which circulates in Paris&mdash;&ldquo;He votes with his cap
[merely by nodding his assent, without speaking] like a monk of
the Sorbonne.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And what about your
half-hour and your sand-glass?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do
they shape your discourses by a certain measure?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for some days
past.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And do they oblige you to speak half an
hour?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, we may speak as shortly as we
like.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But not,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;as much
as you like.&nbsp; What a capital rule for the
ignorant&mdash;what an excellent excuse for those who have
nothing worth saying!&nbsp; But to come to the point, my
father&mdash;this grace which is given to all, is it
sufficient?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And yet it has no effect without <i>efficacious</i>
grace?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Quite true,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And all men have the <i>sufficient</i>, but not all the
<i>efficacious</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Exactly so.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is to say,&rsquo; I urged, &lsquo;that all have
enough grace, and yet not enough&mdash;that there is a grace
which is <i>sufficient</i>, and yet does not
<i>suffice</i>.&nbsp; In good sooth, my father, that is subtle
doctrine.&nbsp; Have you forgotten, in quitting the world, what
the word <i>sufficient</i> means?&nbsp; Do you not remember that
it includes everything necessary for acting? . . .&nbsp; How,
then, do you leave it to be said, that all men have
<i>sufficient</i> grace for acting, while you confess that
another grace is absolutely necessary for acting, and that all
have not this? . . .&nbsp; Is it a matter of indifference to say
that with sufficient grace we can really act?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Indifference!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;why, it is
<i>heresy</i>&mdash;formal <i>heresy</i>.&nbsp; The necessity of
efficacious grace for effective action is a point of
<i>faith</i>.&nbsp; It is heresy to deny this.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where, then, are we now? and what side must I take?&nbsp;
If I deny <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>sufficient grace, I am a
Jansenist.&nbsp; If I admit it, like the Jesuits, so that
efficacious grace is no longer necessary, I shall be a heretic,
you say.&nbsp; And if I admit it, as you do, so that efficacious
grace is still necessary, why I sin against common-sense, I am a
blockhead, say the Jesuits.&nbsp; What can I do in this dilemma,
of being a blockhead, a heretic, or a Jansenist?&nbsp; To what a
strait are we come, if it is only Jansenists, after all, who are
at variance with neither faith nor reason, and who preserve
themselves both from folly and error?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dominican, in short, is made to appear very ridiculous in
his union with the Jesuits.&nbsp; Clearly he fights on their side
against the Jansenists at the expense of his honesty and
consistency.&nbsp; He is confounded by a parable representing the
absurdity of his position.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is all very easy to talk,&rsquo;
was all he could say in reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are an
independent and private person; I am a monk, and in a
community.&nbsp; Do you not understand the difference?&nbsp; We
depend upon superiors; they depend upon others.&nbsp; They have
promised our votes, and what would you have me to
do?&rsquo;&nbsp; We understood his allusion, and remembered how a
brother monk had been banished to Abbeville for a similar
cause.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer is disposed to pity the monk as he relates with a
melancholy tone how the Dominicans, who had from the time of St
Thomas been such ardent defenders of the doctrine of grace, had
been entrapped into making common cause with the Jesuits.&nbsp;
The latter, availing themselves of the confusion and ignorance
introduced by the Reformation, had disseminated their principles
with great rapidity, and become masters of the popular belief;
while the poor Dominicans found themselves in the predicament of
either being denounced as Calvinists, and treated as the
Jansenists then were, or of falling into <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>the use of
a common language with the Jesuits.&nbsp; What other course was
open to them in such a case than that of saving the truth at the
expense of their own credit! and while admitting the name of
sufficient grace, denying, after all, that it was
sufficient!&nbsp; That was the real history of the business.</p>
<p>This pitiful story of the New Thomist awakens a respondent
pity in the writer.&nbsp; But his Jansenist companion is roused
to indignant remonstrance:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Do not flatter yourselves,&rdquo; he
exclaims, &ldquo;that you have saved the truth.&nbsp; If it had
no other protector than you, it would have perished in such
feeble hands.&nbsp; You have received into the Church the name of
its enemy, and this is to receive the enemy itself.&nbsp; Names
are inseparable from things.&nbsp; If the term <i>sufficient</i>
grace be once admitted, you may talk finely about only
understanding thereby a grace insufficient; but this will be of
no avail.&nbsp; Your explanation will be held as odious in the
world, where men speak far more sincerely of less important
things.&nbsp; The Jesuits will triumph.&nbsp; It will be their
sufficient grace, and not yours&mdash;which is only a
name&mdash;which will be accepted.&nbsp; It will be theirs, which
is the reverse of yours, that will become an article of
faith.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In vain the New Thomist proclaims his readiness to suffer
martyrdom rather than allow this, and to maintain the great
doctrine of St Thomas to the death.&nbsp; His allusion to the
importance of the doctrine only calls forth more severely the
indignant eloquence of the Jansenist, and he brings the Letter to
a close in a passage which forestalls the graver and loftier tone
of the later Letters.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Confess, my father, that your order has
received an honour which it ill discharges.&nbsp; It abandons
that grace which has been intrusted to it, and which has never
been <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>abandoned since the creation of the
world.&nbsp; That victorious grace which was expected by
patriarchs, predicted by prophets, introduced by Jesus Christ,
preached by St Paul, explained by St Augustine, the greatest of
the Fathers, embraced by his followers, confirmed by St Bernard,
the last of the Fathers, sustained by St Thomas, the Angel of the
Schools, transmitted by him to your order, maintained by so many
of your fathers, and so gloriously defended by your monks under
Popes Clement and Paul&mdash;that efficacious grace which was
left in your hands as a sacred deposit, that it might always, in
a sacred and enduring order, find preachers to proclaim it to the
world till the end of time&mdash;finds itself deserted for
interests utterly unworthy.&nbsp; It is time that other hands
should arm themselves in its quarrel.&nbsp; It is time that God
should raise up intrepid disciples to the Doctor of Grace, who,
strangers to the entanglements of the world, should serve God for
the sake of God.&nbsp; Grace may no longer count the Dominicans
among her defenders; but she will never want defenders, for she
creates them for herself by her own almighty strength.&nbsp; She
demands pure and disengaged hearts, nay, she herself purifies and
delivers them from worldly interests inconsistent with the truths
of the Gospel.&nbsp; Consider well, my father, and take heed lest
God remove the candle-stick from its place, and leave you in
darkness and dishonour to punish the coldness which you have
shown in a cause so important to His Church.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first two Letters are closely connected.&nbsp; They deal
with the special question between Arnauld and the Sorbonne.&nbsp;
A short &ldquo;Reply from the Provincial&rdquo; is interposed
between the second and third.&nbsp; This reply may be supposed to
be a part of the device employed by Pascal to arouse public
attention and circulate the Letters.&nbsp; The friend in the
country tells how they have excited universal interest.&nbsp;
Everybody has seen them, heard them, and believed them.&nbsp;
They are valued not merely <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>by
theologians, but men of the world, and ladies, have found them
intelligible and delightful reading.&nbsp; This is no exaggerated
picture of the sensation which they produced.&nbsp; Their success
was prodigious, and increased with every successive Letter.&nbsp;
In an atmosphere charged with the theological spirit, yet wearied
with the dulness of theological controversy, Pascal&rsquo;s mode
of treating the subject came as a breath of new life.&nbsp; Here
was one who was evidently no mere theologian&mdash;who knew human
nature as well as Divine truth.&nbsp; His clear and penetrating
intellect saw at once the many aspects of the dispute lying deep
in the human interests and passions engaged; and as he touched
these one by one, and by subtle and vivid strokes brought them to
the front&mdash;as Molinist, New Thomist, and Jansenist appeared
upon the scene, and showed in their natural characters what play
of dramatic life was moving under all the dulness of the debate
at the Sorbonne&mdash;there was a universal outcry of
welcome.&nbsp; The Letters passed from hand to hand.&nbsp; The
post-office reaped a harvest of profit; copies went through the
whole kingdom.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can have no idea how much I am
obliged to you for the Letter you sent me,&rsquo; writes a friend
to a lady; &lsquo;it is so very ingenious, and so nicely
written.&nbsp; It narrates without narrating.&nbsp; It clears up
the most intricate matters possible; its raillery is exquisite;
it enlightens those who know little of the subject, and imparts
double delight to those who understand it.&nbsp; It is an
admirable apology; and if they would take it, a delicate and
innocent censure.&nbsp; In short, the Letter displays so much
art, so much spirit, and so much judgment, that I burn with
curiosity to know who wrote it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the report of the Provincial; and if it is Pascal
himself who speaks, he had little idea that his own <!-- page
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span><i>badinage</i> would be echoed by grave critics, in
after-years, as not in excess of the actual merit of his
productions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The best comedies of
Moli&egrave;re,&rdquo; says Voltaire, &ldquo;have not more wit
than the first Provincial Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must be
admitted that the brightness of the wit is somewhat dimmed after
the lapse of two centuries.&nbsp; Even the genius of Pascal fails
to lighten all the tortuous absurdities of controversies so
purely verbal, and there is an occasional baldness in the clever
device of pitting Molinist, New Thomist, and Jansenist against
one another.&nbsp; The professed artlessness of the speeches is
at times too apparent.&nbsp; But nothing, upon the whole, can be
finer than the address with which this is done; the changes of
scene and the turns of the dialogue are managed with admirable
felicity; there is an exquisite fitness and Socratic point in all
the evolutions of the argument, which we feel even now when we
see so clearly behind the scenes, and know that Molinist and New
Thomist must have had a good deal more to say for
themselves.&nbsp; We have only to imagine the atmosphere of the
Sorbonne, or the wider social atmosphere throughout France in the
seventeenth century, impregnated to its core by a subtle
controversial ecclesiasticism, to realise the impression made by
&ldquo;the Small Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; The question everywhere
was, Who could have written them?&nbsp; There seems at first to
have been no suspicion of Pascal.&nbsp; He had previously only
been known as a scientific writer; and the secret was, of course,
jealously guarded.&nbsp; Although planned at Port Royal des
Champs, he did not remain there while engaged in their
composition.&nbsp; He repaired, as we have already said, to
Paris, and after a while took up his abode &ldquo;at a little inn
opposite to <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>the Jesuit College of Clermont, just
behind the Sorbonne.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he lodged with his
brother-in-law, M. P&eacute;rier, who had lately come to Paris;
and here, too, the latter was visited by P&egrave;re
Defr&eacute;tat, a Jesuit and distant relative, who came to tell
him that the suspicions of the Society were beginning to point to
Pascal.&nbsp; All the while Pascal was busy in the room below;
and, &ldquo;behind the closed curtains of the bed by the side of
which they were talking, a score of fresh impressions of the
seventh Letter were laid out to dry.&rdquo; <a
name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a></p>
<p>Pascal rejoiced in his incognito.&nbsp; It was not till the
controversy had somewhat advanced that he assumed the pseudonym
Louis de Montalte.&nbsp; The third Letter he closed mysteriously
with the letters E. A. A. B. P. A. F. D. E. P., which have been
interpreted to mean &ldquo;Et ancien ami Blaise Pascal,
Auvergnat, fils de &Eacute;tienne Pascal.&rdquo;&nbsp; There can
be no doubt that he took a distinct pleasure in the anonymous
wounds which he inflicted.&nbsp; He had a certain love of
controversy from the beginning, a feeling of self-assertion when
he took up a cause, and a personal ambition to triumph in it,
which carried him forward, and which come out with almost painful
vividness in the closing letters.</p>
<p>The rage of the Jesuits may be imagined.&nbsp; At first they
hardly knew whether to laugh with the world or to be
indignant.&nbsp; The first Letter was read in the dining-hall of
the Sorbonne itself.&nbsp; Some were amused, others greatly
provoked.&nbsp; But, as the Letters proceeded, there was no room
for any feeling but indignation.&nbsp; It was so difficult to set
forth any direct reply to productions mingling such a <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>subtle irony with grave attack.&nbsp; They could only
say of them, as they afterwards more formally did&mdash;<i>Les
menteurs immortelles</i>.&nbsp; Of the first Letters it is said
that 6000 copies were printed; but, as they were easily passed
from hand to hand, this gives no idea of the numbers who actually
read them.&nbsp; Their fame grew with each successive
issue.&nbsp; More than 10,000 copies were printed of the
seventeenth Letter; and editions of the earlier ones were so
frequently reprinted, that it can no longer be told which
belonged really to the first edition.</p>
<p>It is impossible, and would be useless, for us to attempt any
description of the whole series of Letters.&nbsp; We have thought
it right to dwell at some length on the first two, because they
enter so directly into the controversy betwixt Pascal&rsquo;s
friends and the Sorbonne, and because they are really, in some
respects, the cleverest, if not the most valuable.&nbsp; The
third Letter, on the &ldquo;Censure of M. Arnauld,&rdquo; and
again, the three concluding Letters, <a name="citation133"></a><a
href="#footnote133" class="citation">[133]</a> are closely
connected with the first two.&nbsp; Their object, in one form or
another, is the defence of the Jansenist doctrine, and of the
Port Royalists, as its supporters.&nbsp; The intervening twelve
Letters stand quite by themselves.&nbsp; They open up the whole
subject of the moral theology of the Jesuits, and constitute the
most powerful assault probably ever directed against it.&nbsp;
The subject is one <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>which, in a volume like this, we can
only touch upon, and this more with the view of drawing out the
marked literary features of Pascal&rsquo;s assault, than of
meddling with the merits of the controversy which he waged so
relentlessly.&nbsp; In the meantime, we must wind up, as briefly
as possible, the more personal aspects of the controversy.</p>
<p>Between the date of the second and the third Letter, the
process before the Sorbonne had been finished, and M.
Arnauld&rsquo;s censure pronounced.&nbsp; The third Letter deals
with this censure.&nbsp; The writer represents the long
preparation for it, the manner in which the Jansenists had been
denounced as the vilest of heretics, &ldquo;the cabals, factions,
errors, schisms, and outrages with which they have been so long
charged.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who would not have thought, in such
circumstances, that the &ldquo;blackest heresy imaginable&rdquo;
would have come forth under the condemning touch of the
Sorbonne?&nbsp; All Christendom waited for the result.&nbsp; It
was true that M. Arnauld had backed up his opinions by the
clearest quotations from the Fathers, expressing apparently the
very things with which he had been charged.&nbsp; But points of
difference imperceptible to ordinary eyes would no doubt be made
clear under the penetration of so many learned doctors.&nbsp;
Thoughts of this kind kept everybody in a state of breathless
suspense waiting for the result.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, alas! how has
the expectation been balked!&nbsp; Whether the Molinist doctors
have not deigned to lower themselves to the level of instructing
us, or for some other secret reason, they have done nothing else
than pronounce the following words: &lsquo;This proposition is
rash, impious, blasphemous, deserving of anathema, and
heretical!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>It was not to be wondered at, in the circumstances,
that people were in a bad humour, and were beginning to think
that after all there may have been no real heresy in M.
Arnauld&rsquo;s proposition.&nbsp; A heresy which could not be
defined, except in general terms of abuse, seemed at the least
doubtful.&nbsp; The writer is puzzled, as usual, and has recourse
to &ldquo;one of the most intelligent of the Sorbonnists&rdquo;
who had been so far neutral in the discussion, and whom he asks
to point out the difference betwixt M. Arnauld and the
Fathers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; Sorbonnist is amused
at the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of the inquiry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you fancy,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that if they could have found
any difference they would not have pointed it out?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But why, then, pursues the ingenuous inquirer, should they in
such a case pass censure?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How little you understand the
tactics of the Jesuits!&rsquo; is the answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
few will ever look into the matter beyond the fact that M.
Arnauld is condemned!&nbsp; Let it be only cried in the streets,
&ldquo;Here is the condemnation of M. Arnauld!&rdquo;&nbsp; This
is enough to give the Jesuits a triumph with the unthinking
populace.&nbsp; This is the way in which they live and
prosper.&nbsp; Now it is by a catechism in which a child is made
to condemn their opponents; now by a procession, in which
Sufficient Grace leads Efficacious Grace in triumph; and
by-and-by by a comedy, in which the devils carry off Jansen;
sometimes by an almanac; and now by this censure.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The truth is, that it is M. Arnauld himself, and not merely his
opinions, that are obnoxious.&nbsp; Even M. le Moine himself
admitted &lsquo;that the same proposition would have been
orthodox in the mouth of any other; it is only as coming from M.
Arnauld that the Sorbonne have condemned it.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp;
Here is a new species of heresy,&rdquo; concludes the
writer.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not the sentiments of M. Arnauld that
are heretical, but only his person.&nbsp; It is a case of
personal heresy.&nbsp; <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>He is not a
heretic for anything he has said or written, but simply because
he is M. Arnauld.&nbsp; This is all they can say against
him.&nbsp; Whatever he may do, unless he cease to exist he will
never be a good Catholic.&nbsp; The grace of St Augustine will
never be the true grace while he defends it.&nbsp; It would be
all right were he only to combat it.&nbsp; This would be a sure
stroke, and almost the only means of establishing it and
destroying Molinism.&nbsp; Such is the fatality of any opinions
which he embraces.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the three concluding Letters, as we have said, Pascal
reverts to the special subject of Jansenism and Port Royal.&nbsp;
These Letters are considerably longer than the opening
ones.&nbsp; It is of the sixteenth, in fact, that he makes the
well-known remark, that &ldquo;it was very long because he had no
time to make it shorter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon the whole, also, these
Letters are less happy in style and manner.&nbsp; It is evident
that Pascal, if he gave blows which made his opponents and the
opponents of Port Royal wince, also received some bruises in
return.&nbsp; The shamelessness of the attacks made upon his
friends and himself, contemptible as they were in their nature,
left scars upon a mind and temper so sensitive and reserved as
his.&nbsp; The &ldquo;insufferable audacity&rdquo; with which
&ldquo;holy nuns and their directors&rdquo; had been charged with
disbelieving the mysteries of the faith was &ldquo;a crime which
God alone was capable of punishing.&rdquo;&nbsp; To bear such a
charge required a degree of humility equal to that of the nuns
themselves&mdash;to believe it, &ldquo;a degree of wickedness
equal to that of their wretched defamers.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for
himself, it seemed enough to say of him that he belonged to Port
Royal, as if it were only at Port Royal that there could be found
those capable of defending the purity of Christian
morality.&nbsp; He knew and honoured the work <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>of the
pious recluses who had retired to that monastery, although
&ldquo;he had never had the honour of belonging to
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the seventeenth Letter he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have no more to say than that I am not a
member of that community, and to refer you to my letters, in
which I have declared that &lsquo;I am a private
individual;&rsquo; and again in so many words that &lsquo;I am
not of Port Royal.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; You may touch Port Royal if
you choose, but you shall not touch me.&nbsp; You may turn people
out of the Sorbonne, but that will not turn me out of my
lodging.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These statements, of course, are to be received as so far a
part of the disguise under which Pascal pursued his task.&nbsp;
It was true that he had no official connection with Port Royal,
that he was under no rule to live in its retirements, and that he
was only occasionally found there.&nbsp; He was singularly free,
&ldquo;without engagements, entanglement, relationship, or
business of any kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the same he was a Port
Royalist in sympathy and community of opinion.&nbsp; The
interests of Port Royal were his interests, and its friends his
friends.&nbsp; His own sister was one of its zealous
inmates.&nbsp; There is a certain force, therefore, in the taunt
that Pascal, in &ldquo;unmasking the duplicity of the Jesuits,
did not hesitate to imitate it.&rdquo;&nbsp; His statements are
not beyond the licence accorded to those who would drive an enemy
off the scent, and shelter themselves within an anonymity which
they have chosen to assume; but they are none the less artful and
misleading.&nbsp; They justify themselves as the fence of the
<i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>, hardly as the armour of the
moralist.&nbsp; But the truth is, that long before this Pascal
had warmed to his work as a controversialist.&nbsp; He was
determined to give no advantage, and to spare no weapons <!--
page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>within the bounds of decency, that might make the
Jesuits feel the force of his assault.&nbsp; Their accusation of
heresy especially exasperated him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When was I ever seen at Charenton?&rdquo;
<a name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a> he says in the seventeenth Letter,
addressed to the Jesuit Father Annat.&nbsp; &ldquo;When have I
failed in my presence at mass, or in my Christian duty to my
parish church?&nbsp; What act of union with heretics, or of
schism with the Church, can you lay to my charge?&nbsp; What
council have I contradicted?&nbsp; What Papal constitution have I
violated?&nbsp; You <i>must answer</i>, father; else&mdash;you
know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Jansenist doctrine of grace, as we have already explained,
approached indefinitely the doctrine of Calvin.&nbsp; Both were
derived from Augustine; and St Thomas, as his interpreter, handed
on to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the precious
deposit.&nbsp; The line of thought was continuous, and it was not
easy to break it at Calvin, and isolate him as a heretic, while
holding to other teachers as Catholic and orthodox.&nbsp; This
was the dilemma of the New Thomists, so pithily expressed by one
of themselves in the second Letter.&nbsp; But it was also
Pascal&rsquo;s own dilemma; and the consciousness which he and
his friends had of the nearness of the Jansenist doctrine to that
of Calvin, made them all the more sensitive under the charge of
heresy.&nbsp; The Jesuits had art enough to see the advantages
which came from this association.&nbsp; The Port Royalists and
Pascal failed in the magnanimity which clung to a truth no less
because it was identified with an abused name.&nbsp; They
insisted upon <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>distinguishing between the tenets of
Jansen and Calvinism.&nbsp; If what the Papal decree meant and
the Sorbonne meant in the condemnation of the Jansenist
proposition was that they condemned the doctrines of Calvin, then
they were all agreed.&mdash;Jesuits, Jansenists, and Port
Royalists.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Was that all you meant, father?&rdquo; asks
Pascal in his concluding Letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it only the
error of Calvin that you were so anxious to get condemned under
the name of &lsquo;the sense of Jansen&rsquo;?&nbsp; Why did you
not tell us this sooner? you might have saved yourself a world of
trouble; for we were all ready without the aid of bulls or briefs
to join with you in condemning that error. . . .&nbsp; Now, when
you have come the length of declaring that the error which you
oppose is the heresy of Calvin, it must be apparent to every one
that they [the Port Royalists] are innocent of all error; for so
decidedly hostile are they to this, the only error with which you
charge them, that they protest by their discourses, by their
books, by every mode, in short, in which they can testify their
sentiments, that they condemn that heresy with their whole heart,
and in the same manner in which it has been condemned by the
Thomists, whom you acknowledge without scruple to be
Catholics.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The professed point of difference stated in the same
Letter&mdash;namely, that the Thomists and Sorbonnists (and of
course the Port Royalists with them) held that efficacious grace
is resistible, while Calvin held that it was
irresistible&mdash;may or may not hold in reference to special
expressions of Calvin.&nbsp; But there is nothing, upon the
whole, stronger in Calvin than there is in Augustine on the
subject of grace; and on the other hand, an &ldquo;efficacious
grace,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;resistible&rdquo;&mdash;which the
human heart can accept or repel <i>at will</i>&mdash;seems open
to all the ironical play which Pascal directs so skilfully in his
first <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Letters against the Jesuit doctrine
of a <i>sufficient</i> grace which is not yet sufficient.&nbsp;
The truth is, that apart from verbal subtleties, which Pascal
could handle no less familiarly, only far more skilfully, than
his adversaries, there is no rational position intermediate
between the Pelagian doctrine (which is also substantially the
Aristotelian) of free will and moral habit, and the Augustinian
doctrine of Divine grace and spiritual inspiration.&nbsp; The
source of character is either from within the character itself,
which has power to choose good and to be good if it will, or it
is from a higher source&mdash;the grace of God, and the power of
a Divine ordination.&nbsp; These are the only real lines of
controversy.&nbsp; The Christian thinker may decline controversy
on such a subject altogether, acknowledging that the mystery of
character is in its roots beyond our ken,&mdash;that we know not,
and in the nature of the case cannot know, where the Human ends
and the Divine begins.&nbsp; In such a case there is no room for
argument.&nbsp; But we cannot with consistency step off one line
on to the other.&nbsp; In other words, we cannot logically abuse
Calvin while we hold with Augustine, or profess to revere St
Thomas while we abuse Jansen.</p>
<p>But it is more than time to turn from this side of the
&lsquo;Provincial Letters.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was the controversy
out of which they sprang&mdash;which mingles itself most with the
personality of Pascal&mdash;and hence it has claimed a somewhat
detailed treatment.&nbsp; The great subject to which the
intervening and chief portion of the Letters is directed is not,
indeed, more important in itself, but it is more diversified, and
more practically interesting.&nbsp; Here, however, Pascal was
more obviously performing a task than in the other Letters.&nbsp;
He was speaking less out <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>of his
heart.&nbsp; Having grappled with the Jesuits, and noticed their
tactics in the affair of the Sorbonne, he is led to look into
their whole system.&nbsp; He takes up their books and studies
them, in part at least; while his friends Nicole and Arnauld also
study them for him.&nbsp; And the result is the remarkable and
memorable assault contained in his thirteen Letters&mdash;from
the fourth to the sixteenth&mdash;directed against all the main
principles of the Jesuit system.</p>
<p>It would lead us quite away from our purpose to enter into the
range of this great controversy, or to endeavour to estimate its
value, or the merits of the attack and defence on particular
points.&nbsp; The subject is one by itself, more or less entering
into the whole question of morals, and especially the immense
fabric of casuistry or moral theology built up by successive
teachers in the Jesuit schools.&nbsp; Trained, as he was, a
devout disciple of the Roman Church, enthusiastic on behalf of
its doctrines and preachers, Pascal had apparently no knowledge
of the details of Jesuit doctrine and morality before he began
his task of inquiry and assault.&nbsp; Austere and simple in his
own principles of virtue, direct and unbending in his modes of
action, he was evidently appalled by the study of the Jesuit
system, and the endless complexities of compromise and evasion
which it presented.&nbsp; In seizing, as he did everywhere, upon
the immoral aspects of the system, and touching them with the
most graphic colours of exposure, he cannot be said to be unfair;
for the materials with which he dealt were all abundant in their
writings.&nbsp; His quotations may be sometimes taken at random,
and may set forth, without any of the alleviating shades
surrounding them in their proper context, special <!-- page
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>points as parts of a general sequence of thought.&nbsp;
They were, no doubt, often furnished to him by Nicole or Arnauld,
who hunted them through the immense volumes of casuistical
divinity in which they were contained.&nbsp; But there is no
reason to suppose that in any case he has been guilty of
misquotation, or that he has attributed sentiments to the Jesuit
doctors not to be found in them.&nbsp; This is very much his own
statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have been asked if I have myself read all
the books which I have quoted.&nbsp; I answer, No.&nbsp; If I had
done so, I must have passed a great part of my life in reading
very bad books; but I have read Escobar twice through, and I have
employed some of my friends in reading the others.&nbsp; But I
have not made use of a single passage without having myself read
it in the book from which it is cited, without having examined
the subject of which it treats, and without having read what went
before and followed, so that I might run no risk of quoting an
objection as an answer, which would have been blameworthy and
unfair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No doubt this is true.&nbsp; There is all, and more than all,
that Pascal quoted to be found in the Jesuit writings, and his
own language is not too strong in speaking of much that he quotes
as &ldquo;abominable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Notwithstanding, it may be
said that the effect of his representation is a certain
unfairness towards the Jesuits.&nbsp; He presses them at a cruel
advantage when he insists upon developing from his own point of
view, or still more from the mouth of some of their too simple
followers, all the practical consequences of their special
rules.&nbsp; The system of casuistry was one not solely of
Jesuitical invention.&nbsp; It was the necessary outgrowth of the
radical Roman principle of Confession.&nbsp; Nay, it flourished
to some extent within <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>the Protestant Church itself in the
seventeenth century, as the writings of two very different men,
Jeremy Taylor and Richard Baxter, show.&nbsp; Once admit the
principle of directing the conscience by external rather than
internal authority, and you lay a foundation upon which any
amount of folly, and even crime, may be built up.&nbsp; This was
the general principle of Jesuitism as a system of education; but
it came to it from the Church which Pascal, no less than the
Jesuits, revered.&nbsp; Nay, it was in its general character a
principle as characteristic of Port Royal as of Loyola and his
followers.&nbsp; There is the enormous difference, no doubt, that
the ethics of Port Royal were comparatively faithful to the
essential principles of morality which Nature and the Gospel
alike teach&mdash;that its practical excesses were quite in a
different direction from the laxity of the Jesuits.&nbsp; But two
things are to be remembered, not in favour of the Jesuits, but in
explanation of their excesses: 1st, that they aimed, as Pascal
himself points out, at governing the world, and not merely a
sect&mdash;that their whole idea of the Church in relation to the
world was different from that of the Port Royalists; and 2d, that
their system of morals not merely rested on a wrong and dangerous
principle (which Pascal&rsquo;s no less did), but had been
endlessly developed in their schools by many inferior
hands.&nbsp; This was Pascal&rsquo;s great weapon against them,
and so far it was quite a legitimate weapon, as he himself
claimed.&nbsp; As none of their books could appear without
sanction, the Order was more or less responsible for all the
frightful principles set forth in some of these books.&nbsp; All
the same, it is not to be presumed that such a system of moral,
or rather immoral, consequences was <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>deliberately designed by the Society.&nbsp; Pascal
himself exempts them from such a charge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their
object,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is not the corruption of manners;
. . . but they believe it for the good of religion that they
should <i>govern all consciences</i>, and so they have
evangelical or severe maxims for managing some sorts of people,
while whole multitudes of lax casuists are provided for the
multitude that prefer laxity.&rdquo; <a
name="citation144a"></a><a href="#footnote144a"
class="citation">[144a]</a>&nbsp; The Jesuit system of morality,
in short, was the growth of the Jesuit principle of
accommodation, added on to the Roman principle of external
authority.&nbsp; Looking at morality entirely from without, as an
artificial mode of regulating life and society for the supreme
good of the Church, the Jesuit casuists were driven, under the
necessities of such a system, from point to point, till all
essential moral distinction was lost in the mechanical
manipulations of their schools.&nbsp; Whatever happened, no man
or woman was to be lost to the Church; the complications of human
interest and passion were to be brought within its fold and
smoothed into some sort of decent seeming, rather than cast
beyond its pale and made the prey of its enemies. <a
name="citation144b"></a><a href="#footnote144b"
class="citation">[144b]</a>&nbsp; The task was a hopeless
one.&nbsp; In the pages of Pascal the Jesuits too obviously make
a deplorable business both of religion and morality.&nbsp; But
they were as much the victims as the authors of a system which
Rome had sanctioned, and which came directly from the claims
which it made to govern the world not merely by spiritual
suasion, but by external influence.&nbsp; Jesuitism may be bad,
and the Jesuit morality exposed by Pascal abominable, but the one
and the other are the <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>natural outgrowth of a Church which
had become a mechanism for the regulation of human conduct,
rather than a spiritual power addressing freely the human heart
and conscience.</p>
<p>Our space will not admit of an analysis of the thirteen
Letters dealing with the Jesuits, and we can hardly give any
quotations from them.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that Pascal passes
in the fourth Letter to a direct assault upon the Society.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing can equal the Jesuits,&rdquo; the Letter
begins.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have seen Jacobins, doctors, and all sorts
of people; but such a visit as I have made today baffles
everything, and was necessary to complete my knowledge of the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then describes his visit to a very clever
Jesuit, accompanied by his trusty Jansenist friend, and gradually
unfolds from the mouth of the former the whole system of moral
theology which had grown up in the Jesuit schools,&mdash;their
notions of &ldquo;actual grace,&rdquo; or the necessity of a
special conscious knowledge that an act is evil, and ought to be
avoided, before we can be said to be guilty of sin in committing
the act; their famous doctrines of <i>probabilism</i> and of
<i>directing the intention</i>, and all the consequences
springing out of them.&nbsp; Nothing can be more ingenious than
the manner in which the Jesuit is led forward to unfold point
after point of his hateful system, as if it were one of the
greatest boons which had ever been invented for mankind, until
from concession to concession he is plunged into the most
horrible conclusions, and the Jansenist can stand the disclosures
no longer, but breaks forth in the end of the tenth Letter into a
powerful and eloquent denunciation of the doctrines to which he
has been listening.</p>
<p><!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>Any lighter vein that may have lingered in the Letters
is abandoned from this point.&nbsp; Pascal ceases to address his
friend in the country; the playful interchange that sprang from
the idea of a third party, to whom Pascal was supposed to be
merely reporting what he had heard, occurs no more.&nbsp; He
turns to the Jesuit fathers directly, and addresses them, as if
unable any longer to restrain his indignation, commencing the
eleventh Letter with an admirable defence of his previous tone,
and of the extent to which he had used the weapon of ridicule in
assailing them, and passing on to reiterate his charges, and to
repel the calumnies with which they had assailed him and his Port
Royalist friends.&nbsp; The reader may weary, perhaps, for a
little, as he threads his way through the successive accusations,
and the monotonous train of evil principles which underlies them
all, more or less.&nbsp; He may wish that Pascal had gone to the
roots of the system more completely, and had laid bare its
germinal falsehood, instead of heaping detail upon detail, and
always adding a darker hue to the picture which he draws.&nbsp;
But any such mode of treatment would not half so well have served
his purpose.&nbsp; His audience were not prepared for any
philosophy of exposure, still less for any attack upon the
essential principles of the Church; he himself did not see how
the successive laxities which he fixes with his poignant satire,
or sets in the light of his withering scorn, spring from a
vicious conception of Christianity and of the office of the
Church.&nbsp; He does what he does, however, with exquisite
effect; and the Jesuit Order, many and powerful as have been its
opponents, never before nor since felt itself more keenly and
unanswerably assailed.&nbsp; Many of them were forced <!-- page
147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>to
laugh at the picture of their own follies, and the immoral
nonsense which distilled from the lips of Father Bauny and
others, in explanation or defence of their practices.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; says the confidential Jesuit who
expounds to Pascal their system: &ldquo;it is &lsquo;The Summary
of Sins,&rsquo; by Father Bauny; the fifth edition, you see,
which shows that it is a good book.&nbsp; &lsquo;In order to
sin,&rsquo; says Father Bauny, &lsquo;it is necessary to know
that the <i>thing we wish to do is not
good</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A capital
commencement,&rdquo; I remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;only think how far envy will carry some people.&nbsp;
It was on this very passage that M. Hallier, before he became one
of our friends, quizzed Father Bauny, saying of him
&lsquo;<i>Ecce qui tollit peccata mundi</i>&mdash;Behold the man
who taketh away the sins of the world.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147"
class="citation">[147]</a>&nbsp; Then after an elaborate
description of all that goes to make a sin&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O my dear sir,&rsquo; cried I,
&lsquo;what a blessing this will be to some friends of my
acquaintance!&nbsp; You have never, perhaps, in all your life met
with people who have fewer sins to account for!&nbsp; In the
first place, they never think of God at all, still less of
praying to Him; so that, according to M. le Moine, they are still
in a state of baptismal innocence.&nbsp; They have never had a
thought of loving God, or of being contrite for their sins; so
that, according to Father Annat, they have never committed sin
through the want of charity and penitence. . . .&nbsp; I had
always supposed that the less a man thought of God the more he
sinned; but from what I see now, if one could only succeed in
bringing himself not to think of God at all, everything would be
peace with him in all time coming.&nbsp; Away with your
half-and-half sinners who have some love for virtue!&nbsp; They
will be damned every one of them.&nbsp; But as for your
out-and-out sinners, hardened <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>and without
mixture, thorough and determined in their evil courses, hell is
no place for them.&nbsp; They have cheated the devil by stern
devotion to his service!&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148"
class="citation">[148]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is in hits like these, everywhere scattered throughout the
earlier letters, to which no translation can do justice, and
which lose half their edge by being separated from their context,
that the wit of Pascal shines.&nbsp; A more delicate, and at the
same time more scathing irony, cannot be conceived.&nbsp; He hits
with the lightest stroke, and in the most natural manner, yet his
lash cuts the flesh, and leaves an intolerable smart.&nbsp; All
that could be said in answer was, that his representations were
lies.&nbsp; They were conscious exaggerations, no doubt, as all
satirical representations are.&nbsp; This is of their very
nature.&nbsp; But the extent to which they told, and the
bitterness of the feeling which they excited at the time, and
have continued to excite amongst the Jesuits and their friends,
show how much truth there was in them.&nbsp; Nothing can be more
pitiful and less satisfactory than mere complaints of their
falsehood.&nbsp; Such complaints were hardly to have been
expected from any other quarter than the Jesuits
themselves.&nbsp; Yet even Chateaubriand, in his new-born zeal
for the Church, could say of their author, &ldquo;Pascal is only
a calumniator of genius.&nbsp; He has left us an immortal
lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the graver part of the Letters, the following are the only
extracts that our space will permit:&mdash;</p>
<h3>JESUIT LAXITY AND CHRISTIAN INDIGNATION.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such is the way in which our teachers have
discharged men from the &lsquo;painful&rsquo; obligation of
actually loving God.&nbsp; <!-- page 149--><a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>And so
advantageous a doctrine is this, that our Fathers Annat,
Pintereau, Le Moine, and A. Sirmond even, have defended it
vigorously when assailed by any one.&nbsp; You have only to
consult their answers in the &lsquo;Moral Theology;&rsquo; that
of Father Pintereau, in particular (second part), will enable you
to judge of the value of this dispensation by the price which it
has cost, even the blood of Jesus.&nbsp; This is the crown of
such a doctrine.&rdquo;&nbsp; (A quotation is then given from
Father Pintereau to the effect that it is a characteristic of the
new Evangelical law, in contrast to the Judaical, that &ldquo;God
has lightened the troublesome and arduous obligation of
exercising an act of perfect contrition in order to be
justified.&rdquo;)&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;O father,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;no patience can stand this any longer.&nbsp; One cannot
hear without horror such sentiments as I have been listening
to.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;They are not my sentiments,&rsquo; said
the monk.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know that well; but you have expressed
no aversion to them; and far from detesting the authors of such
maxims, you cherish esteem for them.&nbsp; Do you not fear that
your consent will make you a participator in their guilt?&nbsp;
Was it not sufficient to allow men so many forbidden things under
cover of your palliations?&nbsp; Was it necessary to afford them
the occasion of committing crimes that even you cannot excuse by
the facility and assurance of absolution which you offer them? .
. .&nbsp; The licence which your teachers have assumed of
tampering with the most holy rules of Christian conduct amounts
to a total subversion of the Divine law.&nbsp; They violate the
great commandment which embraces the law and the prophets; they
strike at the very heart of piety; they take away the spirit
which giveth life.&nbsp; They say that the love of God is not
necessary to salvation; they even go the length of professing
that this dispensation from loving God is the special privilege
which Jesus Christ has brought into the world.&nbsp; This is the
very climax of impiety.&nbsp; The price of the blood of Jesus,
the purchase for us of a dispensation from loving Him!&nbsp;
Before the incarnation we were under the necessity of loving
God.&nbsp; But since God has so loved the world as to give His
only Son for it, the world, thus redeemed by Him, is discharged
from loving Him!&nbsp; Strange theology <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>of our
time!&mdash;to take away the anathema pronounced by St Paul
against those &ldquo;who love not the Lord Jesus Christ;&rdquo;
to blot out the saying of St John, that &ldquo;he that loveth not
abideth in death;&rdquo; and the words of Jesus Christ Himself,
&ldquo;He that loveth me not keepeth not my
commandments!&rdquo;&nbsp; In this manner those who have never
loved God in life are rendered worthy of enjoying Him throughout
eternity.&nbsp; Behold the mystery of iniquity
accomplished!&nbsp; Open your eyes, my father; and if you have
remained untouched by the other distortions of your Casuists, let
this last by its excess compel you to abandon them.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<a name="citation150a"></a><a href="#footnote150a"
class="citation">[150a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>DEFENCE OF RIDICULE AS A WEAPON IN CONTROVERSY.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What, my fathers! must the imaginations of
your doctors pass for faithful verities?&nbsp; Must we not expose
the sayings of Escobar, <a name="citation150b"></a><a
href="#footnote150b" class="citation">[150b]</a> and the
fantastic and unchristian statements of others, without being
accused of laughing at religion?&nbsp; Is it possible you have
dared to repeat anything so unreasonable? and have you no fear
that in blaming me for ridiculing your absurdities, you were
merely furnishing me with a fresh subject of arousing attack, and
of pointing out more clearly that I have not found in your books
any subject of laughter which is not in itself intensely
ridiculous; and that in making a jest of your moral maxims, I am
as far from making a jest of holy things as the doctrine of your
Casuists distant from the holy doctrine of the Gospel?&nbsp; In
truth, sirs, there is a vast difference between laughing at
religion <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>and laughing at those who profane it
by their extravagant opinions.&nbsp; It were an impiety to fail
in respect for the great truths which the Divine Spirit has
revealed; but it would be no less impiety of another kind to fail
in contempt for falsehoods which the spirit of man has opposed to
them. . . .&nbsp; Just as Christian truths are worthy of love and
respect, the errors which oppose them are worthy of contempt and
hatred: for as there are two things in the truths of our
religion&mdash;a divine beauty which renders them lovable, and a
holy majesty which renders them venerable; so there are two
things in such errors&mdash;an impiety which makes them horrible,
and an impertinence which renders them ridiculous.&rdquo; <a
name="citation151a"></a><a href="#footnote151a"
class="citation">[151a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many examples from the Scriptures and the Fathers are then
quoted in defence of the practice of directing ridicule against
error; and he closes with a singularly appropriate passage from
Tertullian: &ldquo;Nothing is more due to vanity than laughter;
it is the Truth properly that has a right to laugh, because she
is cheerful&mdash;and to make sport of her enemies, because she
is sure of victory.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Do you not think, my fathers, that this
passage is singularly applicable to our subject?&nbsp; The
letters which I have hitherto written are &lsquo;only a little
sport before the real combat.&rsquo;&nbsp; As yet I have been
only playing with the foils, and &lsquo;rather indicating the
wounds that might be given you than inflicting any.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I have merely exposed your sayings to the light, without
commenting on them.&nbsp; &lsquo;If they have excited laughter,
it is only because they are so laughable in
themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; These sayings come upon us with such
surprise, it is impossible to help laughing at them; for nothing
produces laughter more than surprising disproportion between what
one hears and what one expects.&nbsp; In what other way could the
most of these matters be treated? for, as Tertullian says,
&lsquo;To treat them seriously would be to sanction
them.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation151b"></a><a
href="#footnote151b" class="citation">[151b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>APPEAL AGAINST THE JESUITS.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Too long have you deceived the world, and
abused the confidence which men have put in your
impostures.&nbsp; It is high time to vindicate the reputation of
so many people whom you have calumniated; for what innocence can
be so generally acknowledged as not to suffer contamination from
the daring aspersion of a society of men scattered throughout the
world, who, under religious habits, cover irreligious minds; who
perpetrate crimes as they concoct slanders&mdash;not against, but
in conformity with, their own maxims?&nbsp; No one can blame me,
surely, for having destroyed the confidence which you might
otherwise have inspired, since it is far more just to vindicate
for so many good people whom you have decried, the reputation for
piety they deserved, than to leave you a reputation for sincerity
which you have never merited.&nbsp; And as the one could not be
done without the other, how important was it to make the world
understand what you really are.&nbsp; This is what I have begun
to do; but it will require time to complete the work.&nbsp; The
world, however, shall hear of you, my fathers, and all your
policy will not avail to shelter you.&nbsp; The very efforts you
make to ward off the blow will only serve to convince the least
enlightened that you are afraid, and that, smitten in your own
consciences by my charges, you have had recourse to every
expedient to prevent exposure.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a

</blockquote>
<p>The effect of the &lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo; was not
only to alarm the Jesuits, but the Church.&nbsp; The scandal of
their exposure was so deeply felt, that the <i>cur&eacute;s</i>
of Paris and Rouen appointed committees to investigate the
accuracy of Pascal&rsquo;s quotations, and the result of their
investigation was entirely in Pascal&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; This
led ultimately to the matter being carried before a General
Assembly of the clergy of Paris, which, however, declined to give
any <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>formal decision.&nbsp; In the
meantime, an &lsquo;Apology for the Casuists&rsquo; was published
by a Jesuit of the name of Pirot, of such a character as to
increase rather than abate the scandal, and a new controversy
gathered around this publication.&nbsp; The Sorbonne took up the
question, and, after examination, condemned Pirot&rsquo;s Apology
(July 1658) as they had formerly done Arnauld&rsquo;s
propositions, and ultimately it was included by Rome in the
&lsquo;Index Expurgatorius,&rsquo; along with the
&lsquo;Provincial Letters,&rsquo; to which it was designed as a
reply.&nbsp; While the question was before the Sorbonne, the
<i>cur&eacute;s</i> of Paris published various writings, under
the name of &lsquo;Facta,&rsquo; in support of the conclusions to
which they had come.&nbsp; These writings were prepared in
concert with Pascal and his friends, and the second and fifth are
ascribed entirely to his pen.&nbsp; It is even said that he
looked upon the latter, in which he drew a parallel betwixt the
Jesuits and Calvinists (to the disadvantage of the Protestants),
as the <i>best thing he ever did</i>. <a
name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153"
class="citation">[153]</a>&nbsp; Long after Pascal&rsquo;s death
(in 1694) an elaborate answer appeared, by Father Daniel, to the
&lsquo;Provincial Letters,&rsquo; under the title of
&lsquo;Entretiens de Cl&eacute;andre et d&rsquo;Eudoxe sur les
Lettres au Provincial;&rsquo; but notwithstanding a certain
amount of learning and apparent candour, the reply made no
impression upon the public.&nbsp; Even the Jesuits themselves
felt it to be a failure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father Daniel,&rdquo; it
was said, &ldquo;professed to have reason and truth on his side;
but his adversary had in his favour what goes much farther with
men,&mdash;the arms of ridicule and pleasantry.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
late as 1851 an edition of the &lsquo;Letters&rsquo; appeared by
the Abb&eacute; Maynard, accompanied by a <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>professed
refutation of their misstatements.&nbsp; But the truth is,
Pascal&rsquo;s work is one of those which admit of no adequate
refutation.&nbsp; Even if it be granted that he has occasionally
made the most of a quotation, and brought points together which,
taken separately in their connection, have not the offensive
meaning attributed to them, this touches but little the reader
who has enjoyed their exquisite raillery or has been moved by
their indignant denunciation.&nbsp; The real force of the Letters
lies in their wit and eloquence&mdash;their mingled comedy and
invective.&nbsp; They may be parried or resented&mdash;they can
never be refuted.</p>
<p>We have already quoted Voltaire&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;The
best comedies of Moli&egrave;re have not more wit than the first
Provincial Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bossuet,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;has nothing more sublime than the concluding
ones.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were regarded by him as &ldquo;models of
eloquence and pleasantry,&rdquo; as the &ldquo;first work of
genius&rdquo; that appeared in French prose.&nbsp; When Bossuet
himself was asked of what work he would most wish to have been
the author, he answered, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Provincial
Letters.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;
writes of them (Dec. 21, 1689): &ldquo;How charming they are! . .
.&nbsp; Is it possible to have a more perfect style, an irony
finer, more delicate, more natural, more worthy of the Dialogues
of Plato? . . .&nbsp; And what seriousness of tone, what
solidity, what eloquence in the last eight Letters!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Our Gibbon attributed to the frequent perusal of them his own
mastery of &ldquo;grave and temperate irony.&rdquo;&nbsp; Boileau
pronounced them &ldquo;unsurpassed&rdquo; in ancient or modern
prose.&nbsp; Encomiums could hardly go higher, and yet the
language of Perrault is in a still higher strain: &ldquo;There is
more wit in these eighteen Letters than in Plato&rsquo;s <!--
page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>Dialogues; more delicate and artful raillery than in
those of Lucian; and more strength and ingenuity of reasoning
than in the orations of Cicero.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their style
especially is beyond all praise.&nbsp; It has &ldquo;never been
surpassed, nor perhaps equalled.&rdquo;&nbsp; There may be, as
there is apt to be in all such concurrent verdicts, a strain of
excess.&nbsp; The duller English sense may not catch all the
finer edges of a style which it may yet feel to be exquisite in
its general clearness, harmony, and point; the absurdities of
verbal argument and of Jesuit sophistry may sometimes pall upon
the attention, and hardly raise a smile at this time of
day.&nbsp; It is the fate of even the finest polemical literature
to grow dead as it grows old; yet none can doubt the immortality
of the genius which has so long given life to such a controversy,
and charmed so many of the highest judges of literary form.&nbsp;
It is not for any Englishman to challenge the verdict of a
Frenchman in a matter of style.</p>
<p>Pascal himself evidently thought highly of his success.&nbsp;
He liked the controversy, its excitement, and the applausive echo
which followed each Letter.&nbsp; Like every true artist, he felt
the joy and yet the gravity of his work.&nbsp; He took up his pen
with a pleasurable sense of mastery, and yet he wrote some of the
Letters six or seven times over.&nbsp; He spared no pains, yet he
never wearied.&nbsp; All his intellectual life for the time was
thrown into the controversy, and his most finely-tempered strokes
made music in his own mind, while they carried confusion to his
adversaries and triumph to his friends.&nbsp; The sensation made
by the Letters was, of course, mainly confined to France; but the
nervous Latinity of Nicole soon communicated something of the
same sensation to a wider <!-- page 156--><a

class="citation">[156]</a>&nbsp; Pascal has himself told us that
he never repented having written them, nor &ldquo;the amusing,
agreeable, ironical style&rdquo; in which they were
written.&nbsp; Even the condemnation of the Papal See, abject in
some respects as was his devotion to his Church, did not move him
on this point.&nbsp; He left on record, amongst his Thoughts, the
following solemn declaration: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">If my
Letters are condemned in Rome</span>, <span class="smcap">what i
condemn in them is condemned in heaven</span>.&nbsp; <span

THE &lsquo;PENS&Eacute;ES.&rsquo;</h2>
<p>From Pascal&rsquo;s finished work we turn to his unfinished
Remains.&nbsp; The one will always be regarded as the chief
monument of his literary skill, and of the executive completeness
of his mind.&nbsp; But the other is the worthier and nobler
tribute to the greatness of his soul, and the depth and power of
his moral genius.&nbsp; Few comparatively now read the
&lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo; as a whole; fewer still are
interested in the controversy which they commemorate.&nbsp; But
there are hardly any of higher culture&mdash;none certainly of
higher thoughtfulness&mdash;to whom the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; are not still attractive, and who
have not sought in them at one time or another some answer to the
obstinate questionings which the deeper scrutiny of human life
and destiny is ever renewing in the human heart.&nbsp; No answer
may have been found in them, but every spiritual mind must have
so far met in the author of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; a
kindred spirit which, if it has seen no farther than others, has
yet entered keenly upon the great quest, and traversed with a
singular boldness the great lines of higher speculation that
&ldquo;slope through darkness up to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>The literary history of the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; is a very curious one.&nbsp; They
first appeared in the end of 1669, in a small duodecimo volume,
with the appropriate motto, &ldquo;Pendent opera
interrupta.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their preparation for the press had been
a subject of much anxiety to Pascal&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; What
is known as the &ldquo;Peace of the Church&rdquo;&mdash;a period
of temporary quiet and prosperity to Port Royal&mdash;had begun
in 1663; and it was important that nothing should be done by the
Port Royalists to disturb this peace.&nbsp; It had been agreed,
therefore, that all passages bearing on the controversy with the
Jesuits and the Formulary should be omitted; but beyond this
Madame P&eacute;rier desired that the volume should only contain
what proceeded from her brother, and in the precise form and
style in which it had left his hand.&nbsp; She evidently lacked
full confidence in the Committee of Editors, of whom the Duc de
Roannez was the chief, notwithstanding their professions of
strict adherence to the manuscripts.&nbsp; The volume at last
appeared, with a preface by her own son, and no fewer than nine
&ldquo;approbations,&rdquo; signed amongst others by three
bishops, one archdeacon, and three doctors of the Sorbonne.</p>
<p>Unhappily Madame P&eacute;rier had too much cause for
alarm.&nbsp; Editors and Approvers alike had claimed the liberty,
not only of arranging but of modifying both the matter and the
style of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; and this
notwithstanding a statement in the preface that, in giving, as
they professed to do, only &ldquo;the clearest and most
finished&rdquo; of the fragments, they had given them as they
found them, <i>without adding or changing anything</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These fragments,&rdquo; says M. Faug&egrave;re,
&ldquo;which sickness and death had left unfinished, suffered,
without ceasing <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>to be immortal, all the mutilation
which an exaggerated prudence or a misdirected zeal could
suggest, with the view not only of guarding their orthodoxy, but
of embellishing their style&mdash;the style of the author of the
&lsquo;Provincials&rsquo;!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There are
not,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;twenty successive lines which do not
present some alteration, great or small.&nbsp; As for total
omissions and partial suppressions, they are without
number.&rdquo;&nbsp; M. Cousin is equally emphatic.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;examples of every kind
of alteration&mdash;alteration of words, alteration of phrases,
suppressions, substitutions, additions, arbitrary compositions,
and, what is worse, decompositions more arbitrary
still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to defend the first editors of the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it should be remembered
that their task was one not only of theological perplexity, but
of great literary difficulty.&nbsp; Pascal&rsquo;s manuscripts
were a mere mass of confused papers, sometimes written on both
sides, and in a hand for the most part so obscure and imperfectly
formed as to be illegible to all who had not made it a special
study.&nbsp; The papers were pasted or bundled together without
any natural connection, parts containing the same piece being
sometimes intersected and sometimes widely separated from one
another.&nbsp; If the editors, therefore, did their work ill, it
was partly no doubt from incompetency, but partly from its
inherent difficulty, and from the fact that being so near to
Pascal they could hardly appreciate the feelings of the modern
critic as to the sacredness of his style, and of all that came
from his pen.</p>
<p>The edition of 1669 continued to be reprinted with little
alteration for a century.&nbsp; Various additional <!-- page
160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>fragments were brought to light, especially the famous
conversation between De Saci and Pascal regarding Epictetus and
Montaigne; but the form of the fragments remained
unchanged.&nbsp; It was not till the edition of Condorcet in 1776
that they can be said to have undergone any new
<i>r&eacute;daction</i>.&nbsp; Unhappily Pascal suffered in the
hands of the Encyclopedists, as he had previously suffered in the
hands of the Jansenists and the Sorbonne.&nbsp; The first editors
had expunged whatever might seem at variance with
orthodoxy.&nbsp; Condorcet suppressed or modified whatever
partook of a too lofty enthusiasm or a too fervent piety.&nbsp;
It became a current idea among the Encyclopedists that the
accident at Neuilly had affected Pascal&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; We
have already seen how Voltaire spoke of this; and he directed an
early attack (1734) upon the doctrine of human nature contained
in the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, in his old age,
he hailed Condorcet&rsquo;s edition, and reissued it two years
later, with an Introduction and Notes by himself.</p>
<p>In the following year, 1779, appeared the elaborate and
well-known edition of Pascal&rsquo;s works by the Abb&eacute;
Bossut, accompanied by an admirable &ldquo;Discours sur la Vie et
les Ouvrages de Pascal.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this edition the remains
are found for the first time in some degree of
completeness.&nbsp; All the fragments published by Port Royal,
and all those subsequently brought to light by Des Molets and
others, are included and arranged in a new order.&nbsp; But
meritorious as were Bossut&rsquo;s editorial labours as a whole,
they did not attempt any restoration of the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; to their original text; and even the
new fragments published by him were not left untouched.&nbsp; He
embodied, for example, the famous conversation with <!-- page
161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>De
Saci, but without giving De Saci&rsquo;s part of the
dialogue.&nbsp; In short, he reproduced, as M. Havet says, all
the faults of the first editors, and made others of his
own.&nbsp; This is the more remarkable that he is said to have
had in his possession a copy of the original manuscripts.&nbsp;
Condorcet, however, consulted the original manuscripts
themselves, without any thought of doing justice to
Pascal&rsquo;s text.</p>
<p>So matters remained till 1842, when M. Cousin published his
famous Report on the subject to the French Academy.&nbsp; The
French public then found to their astonishment that, with so many
editions of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; they had not the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; themselves.&nbsp; While philosophers
had disputed as to his ideas, and critics admired his style, the
veritable Pascal of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; had all the
time lain concealed in a mass of manuscripts in the National
Library.&nbsp; Such a story, it may be imagined, did not lack any
force in the manner in which M. Cousin told it; and an eager
desire arose for a new and complete edition of the
fragments.&nbsp; Cousin had prepared the way, but he did not
himself undertake this task, which was reserved for M.
Faug&egrave;re, whose great edition appeared two years later, in
1844.&nbsp; Nothing can deprive M. Faug&egrave;re of the credit
of being the first editor of a <i>complete</i> and
<i>authentic</i> text of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other editions of distinctive merit have since appeared; and
it may be admitted that, in the natural reaction from the laxity
of former editions, he gave a too literal transcript of the
manuscripts, including some things of little importance, and
others more properly belonging to an edition of the
&lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo; than of the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, whether it be the result
of early association or of <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>greater
familiarity with M. Faug&egrave;re&rsquo;s pages, I own still a
preference for this edition, while admitting the admirable
perspicuity and intelligence of many of M. Havet&rsquo;s notes,
and the splendour of the edition of M. Victor Rochet, the most
recent (1873) that has come under my notice.</p>
<p>The principle observed by M. Faug&egrave;re is strongly
defended in his preface.&nbsp; He allowed himself no
discretionary powers of emendation, because &ldquo;the limits of
such a power might,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;be too easily
overstepped, and would have left room for belief that greater
liberties had been taken than was actually the case.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The manuscripts,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;have been read, or
rather studied, page by page, line by line, syllable by syllable,
to the end; and, with the exception of illegible words (which,
however, are carefully indicated), they have passed completely
into the present edition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far, this principle has been adhered to by subsequent
editors.&nbsp; There has been no further tampering with
Pascal&rsquo;s words, but more or less latitude has been taken in
publishing all the manuscript details, and especially in the
arrangement of the several fragments.&nbsp; Faug&egrave;re
fancied that he could trace in Pascal&rsquo;s own notes the
indication of an interior arrangement, into which the several
parts of his proposed work in defence of religion were intended
to fall; and he has grouped the fragments in his second volume
according to these supposed indications.&nbsp; M. Havet does not
think that it is possible any longer to discover the true order
of the fragments.&nbsp; He does not believe that any such order
existed in the author&rsquo;s own mind.&nbsp; He had a general
design, and certain great divisions; a preface was sketched <!--
page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>here, and a chapter there; but in throwing his thoughts
upon paper as they presented themselves to him, he did not stop
to assort them, or to bring them into any fitting
connection.&nbsp; What Pascal himself did not do, M. Havet does
not think it possible any editor can do.&nbsp; Accordingly, he
recurs to the old, if somewhat arbitrary, arrangement of Bossut,
as the most familiar and useful.&nbsp; M. Rochet follows an
elaborate arrangement, professedly founded on the original plan
of Pascal, as sketched by himself in the conversation reported by
his nephew in the preface to the primary edition of the
fragments.&nbsp; He considers that all the Thoughts find their
natural place in this plan and in no other.&nbsp; But M.
Rochet&rsquo;s classifications are, partly at least, inspired by
his own ecclesiastical tendencies; and he is far from just to the
labours of M. Faug&egrave;re, and the real light and order which
these labours introduced into the development of Pascal&rsquo;s
ideas.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary for us to attempt to hold the balance
between Pascal&rsquo;s several editors, or to say which of them
has most justice on his side.&nbsp; Of two things there can be no
doubt: first, that any special arrangement of the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; so as to give the idea of a
connected book in defence of religion, is, so far,
arbitrary&mdash;the work, that is to say, of the editor rather
than of the author; and secondly, that there is no difficulty,
from the original preface and otherwise, of gathering the general
order of Pascal&rsquo;s ideas, and the method which appeared to
him the true one of meeting the irreligion of his day, and
vindicating the divine truth of Christianity&mdash;points which
shall afterwards come before us.</p>
<p>The special question raised by M. Cousin as to <!-- page
164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Pascal&rsquo;s scepticism will also be best discussed
in its true order, in connection with such passages as have
suggested it.&nbsp; Considering Pascal&rsquo;s traditionary
reputation as the defender of religion, there was a character of
surprise in this question, that forced a lively debate, as soon
as it was raised, in France and Germany, and even England.&nbsp;
Vinet and Neander both joined in it; and the two lectures
delivered by the latter before the Royal Academy of Sciences in
Berlin in 1847, are highly deserving of perusal by all students
of philosophy. <a name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164"
class="citation">[164]</a>&nbsp; But the issue is an absurd one,
before the combatants are agreed as to the meaning of the word
Scepticism, and before the reader has before him the views of
Pascal, and the manner in which he defines his own attitude in
relation to what he considered the two great lines of thought
opposed to Christianity.&nbsp; When we are in possession of his
own statements, we may find that much of the indignant rhetoric
of M. Cousin is beside the question, and that, although Pascal
was certainly no Cartesian, and has used some strong and rash
expressions about the weakness of human reason, neither is he a
sceptic in any usual sense.&nbsp; He has, in fact, defined his
own position with singular clearness and force.</p>
<p>But before turning to his views on these higher subjects, it
will be well to present our readers with some of Pascal&rsquo;s
more miscellaneous and general Thoughts.&nbsp; In doing so, it is
not necessary, in such a volume as this, that we indicate
throughout the edition from which we take our quotations.&nbsp;
We shall quote from the editions of <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Faug&egrave;re or Havet, as may be most convenient, and
take them in such order as suits our own purpose of exhibiting
Pascal&rsquo;s mind as clearly as we can.&nbsp; For the same
reason, we shall give such passages as appear to us not always
the most just or accurate in thought, but the most characteristic
or representative of the veritable Pascal, whose true words were
so long concealed from the world.&nbsp; We cannot do better, in
the first instance, than note what so great a mathematician has
to say of geometry and the &ldquo;mathematical mind,&rdquo;
compared with the naturally <i>acute</i> mind
(&ldquo;l&rsquo;esprit de finesse&rdquo;), betwixt which he draws
an interesting parallel.&nbsp; The fragment on the
&ldquo;Mathematical&rdquo; or &ldquo;Geometric Mind&rdquo; was,
with the exception of a brief passage given by Des Molets <a
name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a> in 1728, originally published,
although with numerous suppressions, in Condorcet&rsquo;s edition
of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;&nbsp; It appeared for the
first time in its complete form, and under its proper title, in
Faug&egrave;re&rsquo;s edition, along with its natural pendant,
the closely-allied fragment, entitled &ldquo;L&rsquo;Art de
Persuader.&rdquo;&nbsp; We give a few passages from the first
fragment:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We may have three principal objects in the
study of truth&mdash;one to discover it when we seek it, another
to demonstrate it when we possess it, and a third and last to
discriminate it from the false when we examine it. . . .&nbsp;
Geometry excels in all three, and especially in the art of
discovering unknown truths, which it calls <i>analysis</i>. .
.&nbsp; There is a method which excels geometry, but is
impossible to man, <i>for whatever transcends geometry transcends
us</i> [in natural science, as he explains elsewhere].&nbsp; This
is the method of defining everything and proving everything. .
.&nbsp; A fine method, but impossible; since it is evident that
the first <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>terms that we wish to define,
suppose precedent terms necessary for their explanation&mdash;and
that the first propositions that we wish to prove, suppose others
which precede them; and so it is clear we can never arrive at
absolutely first principles.&nbsp; In pushing our researches to
the utmost, we necessarily reach primitive words that admit of no
further definition, and principles so obvious, that they require
no proof.&nbsp; Man can never, therefore, from natural
incompetency, possess an absolutely complete science. . . .&nbsp;
But geometry, while inferior in its aims, is absolutely certain
within its limits.&nbsp; It neither defines everything, nor
attempts to prove everything, and must, so far, yield its
pretension to be an absolute science; but it sets out from things
universally admitted as clear and constant, and is therefore
perfectly true, because in consonance with nature.&nbsp; Its
function is not to define things universally clear and
understood, but to define all others; and not to attempt to prove
things intuitively known to men, but to attempt to prove all
others.&nbsp; Against this, the true order of knowledge, those
alike err who attempt to define and to prove everything, and
those who neglect definition and demonstration where things are
not self-evident.&nbsp; This is what geometry teaches
perfectly.&nbsp; It attempts no definition of such things as
<i>space</i>, <i>time</i>, <i>motion</i>, <i>number</i>,
<i>equality</i>, and the like, because these terms designate so
naturally the things which they signify, that any attempt at
making them more clear ends in making them more obscure.&nbsp;
For there is nothing more futile than the talk of those who would
define primitive words. <a name="citation166"></a><a
href="#footnote166" class="citation">[166]</a></p>
<p>. . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;In geometry the principles are palpable, but removed
from common use. . . .&nbsp; In the sphere of natural wit or
acuteness, the principles are in common use and before all
eyes&mdash;it is only a question of having a good view of them;
for they are so subtle and numerous, that some are almost sure to
escape observation. . . .&nbsp; All geometers would be men of
acuteness if they had sufficient insight, for they <!-- page
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>never reason falsely on the principles recognised by
them.&nbsp; All fine or acute spirits would be geometers if they
could fix their thoughts on the unwonted principles of
geometry.&nbsp; The reason why some finer spirits are not
geometers is, that they cannot turn their attention at all to the
principles of geometry; but geometers fail in finer perception,
because they do not see all that is before them, and being
accustomed to the plain and palpable principles of geometry, and
never reasoning until they have well ascertained and handled
their principles, they lose themselves in matters of intellectual
subtlety, where the principles are not so easily laid hold
of.&nbsp; Such things are seen with difficulty; they are felt
rather than seen.&nbsp; They are so delicate and multitudinous
that it requires a very delicate and neat sense to appreciate
them. . . .&nbsp; So it is as rare for geometers to be men of
subtle wit as it is for the latter to be geometers, because
geometers like to treat these nicer matters geometrically, and so
make themselves ridiculous; they like to commence with
definition, and then go on to principles&mdash;a mode which does
not at all suit this sort of reasoning.&nbsp; It is not that the
mind does not take this method, but it does so silently,
naturally, and without conscious art.&nbsp; The perception of the
process belongs only to a few minds, and those of the highest
order. . . .&nbsp; Geometers, who are only geometers, are sure to
be right, provided the subject come within their scope, and is
capable of explanation by definition and principles.&nbsp;
Otherwise they go wrong altogether, for they only judge rightly
upon principles clearly set forth and established.&nbsp; On the
other hand, subtle men, who are only subtle, lack patience, in
matters of speculation and imagination, to reach first principles
which they have never known in the world, and which are entirely
beyond their beat. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are different kinds of sound sense.&nbsp; Some
succeed in one order of things, and not in another, in which they
are simply extravagant. . . .&nbsp; Some minds draw consequences
well from a few principles, others are more at home in drawing
conclusions from a great variety of principles.&nbsp; For
example, some understand well the phenomena of water, with <!--
page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>reference to which the principles are few, but the
results extremely delicate, so that only very great accuracy of
mind can trace them.&nbsp; Such men would probably not be great
geometers, because geometry involves a multitude of principles,
and because the mind which may penetrate thoroughly a few
principles to their depth may not be at all able to penetrate
things which combine a multitude of principles. . . .&nbsp; There
are two sorts of mind: the one fathoms rapidly and deeply the
consequences of principles&mdash;this is the observant and
accurate mind; the other embraces a great multitude of
principles, without confounding them&mdash;and this is the
mathematical mind.&nbsp; The one is marked by energy and
accuracy, the other by amplitude.&nbsp; But the one may exist
without the other.&nbsp; The mind may be powerful and narrow, or
it may be ample and weak.&rdquo; <a name="citation168"></a><a

</blockquote>
<p>Few of Pascal&rsquo;s Thoughts are more interesting than those
on &ldquo;Eloquence and Style.&rdquo;&nbsp; So great a master of
the art of expression had naturally something to say on these
subjects.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Continued eloquence wearies.&nbsp; Princes
and kings amuse themselves sometimes; they are not always upon
their thrones&mdash;they tire of these.&nbsp; Grandeur must be
laid aside in order to be realised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eloquence is a picture of thought; and thus those who,
after having drawn a picture, still go on, make a tableau and not
a likeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eloquence is the art of saying things in such a
manner&mdash;first, that those to whom they are addressed can
understand them without trouble and with pleasure; and secondly,
that they may be interested in them in such a way that their
<i>amour propre</i> may lead them gladly to reflect upon
them.&nbsp; It consists, therefore, in a correspondence
established between the mind and heart of the hearers on the one
side, and the <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>thoughts and expressions used on the
other, and so implies a close study of the human heart in order
to know all its springs, and to find the due measures of speech
to address to it.&nbsp; It must confine itself, as far as
possible, to the simplicity of nature, and not make great what is
small, nor small what is great.&nbsp; It is not enough that a
thing be fine, it must be fitting,&mdash;neither in excess nor
defect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eloquence should prevail by gentle suasion, not by
constraint.&nbsp; It should reign, not tyrannise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some who speak well, and who do not write
well.&nbsp; The place&mdash;the assembly&mdash;excites them, and
draws forth their mind more than they ever experience without
such excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who make antitheses by forcing the sense are like
men who make false windows for the sake of symmetry.&nbsp; Their
rule is not to speak correctly, but to make correct
figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be in eloquence always what is true and
real; but that which is pleasing should itself be the
real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we meet with the natural style we are surprised
and delighted, for we expected to find an author, and we find a
man; whilst those of good taste who in looking into a book think
to find a man, are altogether surprised to find an author.&nbsp;
<i>Plus poetice quam humane locutus es</i>.&nbsp; They honour
nature most who teach her that she can speak best on all
subjects&mdash;even on theology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are men who always dress up nature.&nbsp; No mere
king with them, but an august monarch.&nbsp; No Paris, but the
capital of the kingdom.&nbsp; There are places in which it is
necessary to call Paris Paris; others, where we must call it the
capital of the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When in composition we find a word repeated, and on
trying to correct it find it so suitable that a change would
spoil the sense, it is better to let it alone.&nbsp; This stamps
it as fitting, and it is a stupid feeling which does not
recognise that repetition in such a case is not a fault; for
there is no universal rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The meaning itself changes with the words which <!--
page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>express it.&nbsp; The meaning derives its dignity from
the words, instead of imparting it to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing that we discover in writing a book is to
know what to put at the beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a discourse paints a passion or effect naturally,
we find in ourselves the truth of what we hear, which was there
without our knowing it, so that we are led to like the man who
discovers so much to us.&nbsp; For he does not show us his own
good, but ours; and this good turn makes him lovable.&nbsp;
Besides that, the community of intelligence we have with him
necessarily inclines the heart towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let none allege that I have said nothing new.&nbsp; The
arrangement of the matter is new.&nbsp; When we play at tennis,
both play with the same ball; but one plays better than the
other.&nbsp; They might as well accuse me of using old words, as
if the same thoughts differently arranged would not form a
different discourse; just as the same words differently arranged
express different thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a definite standard of taste and beauty, which
consists in a certain relation between our nature&mdash;it may be
weak or strong, but such as it is&mdash;and the thing that
pleases us.&nbsp; All that is formed to this standard delights
us,&mdash;house, song, writing, verse, prose, women, buds,
rivers, trees, rooms, dress, etc.&nbsp; All that is not formed by
this standard disgusts men of good taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never judge of the same thing exactly in the same
manner.&nbsp; I cannot judge of my work in the course of doing
it.&nbsp; I must do as painters do, place myself at a distance
from it, but not too far.&nbsp; How then?&nbsp; You may
guess.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not look to Pascal especially for worldly insight, or
for that sharp knowledge of men that make the sayings of clever
social writers like Rochefoucauld or Horace Walpole memorable, if
not always wise or kind.&nbsp; But there are many of the Thoughts
which show that the penitent of Port Royal had looked with clear
observant eyes below the surface of Paris society, and that he
had <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>a deep sense not only of the moral
but the social weaknesses of humanity.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When passion leads us towards anything, we
forget duty; as we like a book we read it, while we ought to be
doing something else.&nbsp; In order to be reminded of our duty,
it is necessary to propose to do something that we dislike; then
we excuse ourselves on the ground that we have something else to
do, and so we recollect our duty by this means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wisely are men distinguished by their exterior
rather than by their interior qualifications!&nbsp; Which of us
two shall take the lead?&nbsp; Which shall yield
precedence?&nbsp; The man of less talent?&nbsp; But I am as
clever as he.&nbsp; Then we must fight it out.&nbsp; But he has
four lackeys and I have only one.&nbsp; That is a visible
difference.&nbsp; We have only to count the numbers.&nbsp; It is
my place then to give way, and I am a fool to contest the

<p>&ldquo;Respect for others requires you to inconvenience

hate us.&nbsp; So far true, if there was nothing hateful in the

truth.&nbsp; We love to watch in argument the conflicts of

regard it with pleasure, we must see it gradually emerging from
the contest of debate.&nbsp; It is the same with passions: the

farther from my real object than those who were <!-- page

than another, except as circumstances call out their talents. . .

he love <i>her</i>?&nbsp; No; for the smallpox, which will
destroy her beauty without killing her, will cause him to love

<p>&ldquo;How is it that a lame man does not anger us, but a

Epictetus asks also, Why are we not annoyed if any one tells us
that we are unwell in the head, and yet are angry if they tell us
that we reason falsely or choose unwisely?&nbsp; The reason is,
that we know certainly nothing ails our head, or that <!-- page

</blockquote>
<p>Some of the foregoing Thoughts <a name="citation174"></a><a
href="#footnote174" class="citation">[174]</a> may appear to our
readers sufficient to warrant the charge of scepticism, already
adverted to.&nbsp; Pascal certainly speaks at times both of human
life and human reason in a contemptuous manner.&nbsp; Even
Rochefoucauld could hardly express himself more bitterly than he
does now and then when he fixes his clear gaze upon the folly,
the vanity, the weaknesses which make up man&rsquo;s customary
life, and the deceits which he practises upon himself and his
fellows.&nbsp; All the world seems to him at such times &ldquo;in
a state of delusion.&rdquo;&nbsp; If there is truth, it &ldquo;is
not where men suppose it to be.&rdquo;&nbsp; The majority are to
be followed, not &ldquo;because they have more reason, but
because they have more force.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>&ldquo;The power of kings is founded
on the reason and on the folly of the people, but chiefly on
their folly.&nbsp; The greatest and most important thing in the
world has weakness for its basis, and the basis is wonderfully
secure, for there is nothing more certain than that people will
be weak. . . .&nbsp; Our magistrates well understand this
mystery. . . .&nbsp; Save for their crimson robes, ermine,
palaces of justice, fleur-de-lis, they would never have duped the
world.&nbsp; Where would the physician be without his
&lsquo;cassock and mule,&rsquo; and the theologian without his
&lsquo;square cap and flowing garments&rsquo;?&nbsp; These vain
adornments impress the imagination, and secure respect.&nbsp; We
cannot look at an advocate in his gown and wig without a
favourable impression of his abilities.&nbsp; The soldier alone
needs no disguise, because he gains his authority by actual
force, the others by grimace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In such sentences, as well as in some previously quoted, the
cynicism of both Hobbes and Montaigne seems to speak.&nbsp; Man
is really a fool, and society rests upon force.&nbsp; The further
down we go, we come, not to any natural rights, or essential
principles of justice, which reason is capable of judging, but
only to a mass of customs built up out of selfish instincts, and
controlled by external influence.&nbsp; Pascal repeats Montaigne
over and over again, and seems to make many of his cynicisms his
own.&nbsp; This is not to be denied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Montaigne is
right.&nbsp; Custom should be followed because it is custom, and
because it is found to be established, without inquiry whether it
be reasonable or not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet he puts in a caveat, as we
shall see more fully afterwards, just when he seems most to have
identified himself with the representative of scepticism.&nbsp;
In blindly following custom, he reserves &ldquo;those matters
which are not contrary to natural or divine right;&rdquo; and the
root of custom, even in the popular mind, he believes to be a dim
sense of justice.&nbsp; Again, in a similar vein, <!-- page
176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>he
asks, &ldquo;Why follow ancient laws and ancient opinions?&nbsp;
<i>Are they wiser</i>?&nbsp; <i>No</i>.&nbsp; But they stand
apart from present interests; and <i>thus take away the root of
difference</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, as so often, the moralist
supplants the sceptic, and suggests a higher thought, while
seeming to approve of a superficial Pyrrhonism.</p>
<p>It is easy, in one sense, to make out a case of scepticism
against Pascal.&nbsp; He always writes strongly.&nbsp; There is
passion in all his thought.&nbsp; He had a strong and deep sense
of human weakness, and incapacity to attain the highest
truth.&nbsp; He spoke of the philosophy of Descartes without
respect.&nbsp; With most of the Port Royalists, indeed, he seems
to have concurred in the Cartesian doctrine of automata, <a
name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"
class="citation">[176]</a> strangely revived in our day by
Professor Huxley.&nbsp; But he repudiated the notion <!-- page
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>of
&ldquo;subtle matter,&rdquo; and even spoke of it with contempt
(<i>dont il se moquait fort</i>).&nbsp; &ldquo;He could not
bear,&rdquo; his niece tells us, in a passage often quoted and
emphasised, &ldquo;the Cartesian manner of explaining the
formation of all things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot forgive
Descartes,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He would willingly in all
his philosophy have done without God, if he could; but he could
not get on without letting him give the world a fillip to set it
agoing: after that, he has nothing more to do with
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether he had studied Descartes or not, he
evidently did not share the enthusiasm of Arnauld and others for
his philosophy.&nbsp; He even spoke of it as &ldquo;useless,
uncertain, and troublesome&mdash;nay, as ridiculous.&rdquo; <a
name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a>&nbsp; He has added, in that brusque,
rapid, forceful style characteristic of many of his Thoughts,
that &ldquo;he did not think the whole of philosophy worth an
hour&rsquo;s trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;To set light by
philosophy is the true philosophy.&rdquo;&nbsp; When we look at
such expressions, and many others, it is not to be wondered at
that Pascal has been accused of scepticism.&nbsp; As he could not
forgive Descartes, so Cousin cannot forgive him for his
depreciation of Descartes.&nbsp; One who saw nothing in
Cartesianism or philosophy in general beyond what these rash
sentences, freshly restored in all their audacity, declare, could
be nothing but an &ldquo;enemy of all philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible not to feel that there is some ground for
this accusation, and that, if we were to draw our knowledge of
Pascal merely from such passages, Cousin makes out something of a
case against him.&nbsp; But many other passages, hardly less
emphatic, must make every candid reader pause before he comes to
any definite <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>conclusion on the subject, if it is
necessary to come to such a conclusion at all.&nbsp; It must
never be forgotten that we have nowhere the complete mind of
Pascal; that it was of the very nature of thoughts rapidly dashed
upon paper&mdash;as the very form of many we have quoted clearly
indicates they were&mdash;to be one-sided and often
extravagant.&nbsp; Pascal, of all men, is not to be measured by
his strong expressions.&nbsp; His intellectual nature, while
profound, was narrow and intense.&nbsp; He put his whole soul
into what moved him for the time; and a certain excess of
passionate intellectual emotion evidently speaks in some of the
most striking of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;&nbsp; We may
imagine how in some&mdash;perhaps in many&mdash;cases they would
have been toned down had he lived to revise and refashion them
into a harmonious whole.&nbsp; That interior
elaboration,&mdash;&ldquo;a kind of second creation of
genius,&rdquo; as M. Faug&egrave;re says&mdash;which no one else
may venture upon,&mdash;would undoubtedly have come from his own
masterly hand, if it had been given him to bring fragment to
fragment, and to fit them together into a complete fabric.&nbsp;
It would be a hard thing to judge any student, and especially a
student like Pascal, by the scattered notes of his library table;
and precious as these fragments are, we must remember that this
is their character, and nothing else.&nbsp; The fact that we now
have them in all their native <i>hardiesse</i> makes this caution
not the less but all the more necessary.</p>
<p>In passing on to consider more particularly Pascal&rsquo;s
philosophical and religious attitude, we shall see more fully the
bearing of these remarks.&nbsp; Pascal, in point of fact,
embraces many points of view; and, if he leans sometimes to
scepticism, he sees also the strong side of <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>what he
calls dogmatism or rational philosophy.&nbsp; The very
exaggerations of his language, now on this side and now on that,
show that he himself is more than either, as his own words
bear.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is necessary,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to
have three qualities&mdash;those of the Pyrrhonist, of the
geometrician (the dogmatist), and of the humble Christian.&nbsp;
These unite with and attemper one another, so that we doubt when
we should, we aim at certainty when we should, and we submit when
we should.&rdquo;&nbsp; He certainly thought that he had found a
surer road to truth than either Dogmatism or Pyrrhonism.&nbsp;
Whether he succeeded in doing so will appear as we proceed.</p>
<p>The famous conversation with De Saci, when he entered Port
Royal, must be taken as the chief key to Pascal&rsquo;s own
philosophical attitude.&nbsp; There is nowhere in any of the
Thoughts so complete an exhibition of his point of view; and all
the editors who have most entered into Pascal&rsquo;s
spirit&mdash;Sainte-Beuve, Faug&egrave;re, and Havet
alike&mdash;have recognised its importance.&nbsp; It is really,
as Havet says, of the nature of an introduction to the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this conversation Pascal signalises what he believes to be
the two great opposing systems of human philosophy at all times;
the rational, dogmatic, or Stoical, on the one hand&mdash;the
sceptical, or Epicurean, on the other.&nbsp; He takes Epictetus
as the representative of the one; Montaigne as the representative
of the other.&nbsp; In depicting dogmatism at other times, he
seems to have Descartes especially in view; but in speaking of
scepticism and Pyrrhonism (which is his own expression), it is
always Montaigne that he has before him.&nbsp; Montaigne is
Pyrrhonist <i>par excellence</i>; and undoubtedly <!-- page
180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>the famous Essays had greatly fascinated Pascal, like
many others in his generation.&nbsp; He was constantly drawn to
them as embodying one, and that a deep, phase of his own
experience.&nbsp; He felt his own thought expressed in many pages
of Montaigne, and had that favour for the Essays that every
thoughtful man has for the book that makes his own experience
alive, and brings it clearly before him.&nbsp; But he has, at the
same time, made plainly intelligible his own differences from
Montaigne, and marked with his usual boldness the limitations of
his thought.&nbsp; If Pascal is Pyrrhonist, he is certainly not
Pyrrhonist after the manner of Montaigne, deeply as he responds
to many of the notes of the Essays, and at times seems to make
them his own.</p>
<p>The conversation with De Saci took place in 1654, when Pascal
first went to Port Royal des Champs, and De Saci became his
spiritual director.&nbsp; We owe its preservation to Fontaine,
from whose manuscript &lsquo;Memoirs&rsquo; it was extracted, and
first published in 1728 by Des Molets.&nbsp; After all the labour
of Faug&egrave;re, Havet believes himself to have given for the
first time the correct text of the conversation from the original
print of Des Molets, based on Fontaine&rsquo;s manuscripts,
rather than from the text of the &lsquo;Memoirs&rsquo; as
afterwards published.&nbsp; Fontaine describes in his
<i>na&iuml;ve</i> manner the impression made by Pascal upon De
Saci, and how the brilliancy of power which had charmed all the
world could not be hidden within the shades of Port Royal.&nbsp;
Ignorant of the Fathers of the Church, he had found by his own
mental and spiritual penetration the very truths to be met with
in them; and De Saci seemed to see another St Augustine before
him in the wonderful talk of the gifted penitent.&nbsp; <!-- page
181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>It
was his practice in dealing with his penitents to adapt his
conversation to their peculiar powers.&nbsp; If he spoke with M.
Champagne, for example, he talked with him of painting.&nbsp; If
he saw M. Hamon, he inquired about the art of medicine.&nbsp; If
it was the surgeon of the place, he had something to say of
surgery.&nbsp; All was designed to lead the thoughts from all
human things up to God.&nbsp; With Pascal, therefore, it was
philosophy upon which his conversation fell, to try the depths of
his mind, and see what special direction he needed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pascal told him that the two books most familiar to him
were Epictetus and Montaigne, and he lavished great praise on
both.&nbsp; M. de Saci had always wished to read these two
authors, and asked M. Pascal to explain them fully.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Epictetus,&rdquo; said Pascal, &ldquo;is
one of the philosophers of the world who have best known the
duties of man.&nbsp; Above all things, he would have man regard
God as his chief object&mdash;to be persuaded that He governs all
things with righteousness&mdash;to submit to Him cordially, and
to follow Him willingly, as having made all things with perfect
wisdom.&nbsp; Such a disposition would stay all complaints and
murmurs, and prepare the human mind to bear quietly the most
troublesome events.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never say,&rsquo; he observes
(Enchirid. 11), &lsquo;I have lost that; say rather, I have
restored it.&nbsp; My son is dead; I have surrendered him.&nbsp;
My wife is dead; I have given her up.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so of
every other good. . . .&nbsp; While its use is permitted, regard
it as a good belonging to others, as a traveller does in an
inn.&nbsp; You should not wish,&rsquo; he adds, &lsquo;that
things be as you desire, but you should desire them to be as they
are.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; It is your duty to play well the part
assigned to you, but to choose the part is the act of
Another.&nbsp; Have always death before your eyes, and the evils
which are least supportable, and you would never think meanly of
anything, nor desire anything in excess.&nbsp; He shows in a
thousand ways what is the duty of man.&nbsp; He wishes him to be
humble, <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>to conceal his good resolutions,
especially in their beginnings, that he may carry them out in
secret.&nbsp; Nothing is so ruinous to them as publicity.&nbsp;
He never ceases to repeat that the whole duty and desire of man
ought to be to acknowledge the will of God, and to follow it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such were the lights of this great mind, who has so
well understood the duties of man.&nbsp; I venture to say, that
he would have deserved to be adored if he had only known as well
human weakness; but in order to do this, he must have been God
Himself.&nbsp; Mere man as he was, after having so well explained
human duty, he loses himself in the presumption of human
capacity.&nbsp; He avers that God has given to every man the
means of acquitting himself of all his obligations; that such
means are always within his own power, that happiness is to be
sought by things within our reach, since God has given us them
for this very end.&nbsp; He points out in what our freedom
consists: goods, life, esteem are not in our power, and therefore
do not lead to God; but none can force the mind to believe what
is false, nor the will to love that which will make it
miserable.&nbsp; These two powers are therefore free; and by
these we can render ourselves perfect&mdash;know God perfectly,
love Him, obey Him, please Him&mdash;vanquish all vices, acquire
all virtues, and so make ourselves holy, and the fellows of
God.&nbsp; These principles, truly diabolic in their pride, lead
to other errors&mdash;such as that the soul is a portion of the
Divine substance, that grief and death are not evils, that we may
kill ourselves when we are in such trouble that we may believe
God summons us, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for Montaigne&mdash;of whom you wish me also, my
dear sir, to speak&mdash;being born in a Christian country, he
makes profession of the Catholic religion, and so far there is
nothing peculiar about him.&nbsp; But in the search for a system
of morals dictated by reason without the light of faith, he has
to lay down his principles on this supposition, and to consider
man apart from revelation.&nbsp; He conceives things in such a
universal uncertainty that doubt itself is seized with
uncertainty, and doubts whether it doubts.&nbsp; His scepticism
returns upon itself in a perpetual circle without <!-- page
183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>repose, opposing equally those who maintain that all is
uncertain, and those who maintain that nothing is, so utterly
indisposed is he to any fixity.&nbsp; In this doubt which doubts
itself, and this ignorance which is ignorant of itself, is to be
found the essence of his thought.&nbsp; He cannot express it by
any positive term; for if he was to say that he doubts, he
betrays himself by making it certain that he doubts; and this
being formally against his intention, he can only explain himself
by an interrogation.&nbsp; Not wishing to say, I do not know, he
can only ask, What do I know?&nbsp; He has made this his device,
putting it under a pair of balances, which, weighted in each
scale by a contradiction, hangs in perfect equilibrium.&nbsp; In
other words, he is pure Pyrrhonist.&nbsp; This is the point round
which turn all his discourses and all his essays.&nbsp; This is
the only thing which he leaves fixed, although he may not always
keep it before him. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in this humour, fluctuating and variable as it
is, that he combats with an invincible firmness the heretics of
his time, who assumed to know the exclusive sense of
Scripture.&nbsp; From the same point of view he thunders
vigorously against the horrible impiety of those who dare to be
certain that there is no God!&nbsp; He attacks them especially in
the &lsquo;Apology for Raymond de Sebonde.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having
voluntarily set aside revelation, and abandoned themselves to
their natural light&mdash;all faith set aside&mdash;he asks them
on what authority they, who know not the essential reality of
anything, dare to judge of that Sovereign Being who is infinite
by His very definition.&nbsp; He demands upon what principles
they rest, and presses them to point them out.&nbsp; He examines
all that they bring forward, and so searches them by his
wonderful penetration as to show the hollowness of what passes
for the most clear and established truths.&nbsp; He inquires if
the soul knows anything whatever&mdash;if it knows itself;
whether it is substance or accident, body or spirit; what is each
of these things, and if there is anything belonging to some order
different from either; if the soul knows its own body; if it
knows what matter is, or can distinguish the innumerable
varieties of <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>body produced from matter; how it
can reason if it is material, and how it can be united to a
special body, and feel its passions if it be spiritual.&nbsp;
When did it begin to be, with the body or before, and if it ends
with it or not? . . . .&nbsp; The ideas of God and truth are
inseparable, and if the one is or is not, if the one is certain
or uncertain, the other is necessarily the same.&nbsp; Who knows
if the common sense (<i>le sens commun</i>) which we take as a
judge of the truth is really this, designed for such a
purpose?&nbsp; Who knows what truth is, and how can we be sure of
having it without knowing it?&nbsp; Who knows even what Being is,
since it is impossible to define it; and in trying to do so, it
is necessary to presuppose the very idea itself, and say <i>it
is</i>? . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess, sir, I might look with joy upon the manner
in which the author invincibly crumples up proud reason with its
own arms.&nbsp; I could love with my whole heart the minister of
so mighty a vengeance if, as a faithful disciple of the Church,
he had followed its moral guidance.&nbsp; But he acts, on the
contrary, like a pagan, concluding that we ought to abandon care
for others and dwell in peace, gliding lightly over such subjects
lest we lose ourselves in them, and taking that to be true and
good which at first appears to be so.&nbsp; This is why he
follows everywhere the evidence of the senses and the notions of
the community. . . .&nbsp; In this manner, he says, there is
nothing extravagant in his conduct.&nbsp; He does as others
do.&nbsp; Whatever they do in the foolish thought that they are
following the true good, he does from another principle, that as
the probabilities (<i>vraisemblances</i>) are equally on one side
and the other, so example and convenience carry the day with
him.&nbsp; He mounts his horse like any one else&mdash;not as a
philosopher&mdash;because the horse allows him to do so, but
without thinking there is any right in the matter, and not
knowing whether the horse, on the contrary, may not be entitled
to make use of him.&nbsp; He puts constraint to himself in order
to shun certain vices; and even guards marriage faithfully,
merely on account of the disorder which would otherwise follow. .
. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot dissemble that in reading Montaigne, and <!--
page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>comparing him with Epictetus, I find in them the two
greatest defenders of the most celebrated sects of the world, who
profess to follow reason rather than revelation.&nbsp; We must
follow one or other.&nbsp; Either there is a God and a Sovereign
Good, or this is uncertain, and all is uncertain,&mdash;whether
there is any true good or not. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The error in both is, in not seeing that the present
state of man differs from that in which he was created.&nbsp; The
one, observing only the traces of his primitive grandeur, and
ignoring his corruption, has treated human nature as if it were
whole, without any need of a Redeemer&mdash;this leads to the
height of pride; the other, sensible of man&rsquo;s present
misery, and ignorant of his original dignity, treats human nature
as necessarily weak and irreparable, and thus, in despair of
attaining any true good, plunges it into a depth of
baseness.&rdquo; <a name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two states, Pascal goes on to argue, must be taken
together before the truth can be reached.&nbsp; Apart, they give
a false picture of man; and generate on the one hand pride, on
the other hand immorality.&nbsp; It is only the Gospel which
unites them, in a right manner, &ldquo;by a divine
art.&rdquo;&nbsp; It brings together the opposites, and explains,
by a wondrous, truly heavenly way, how they may coexist, not as
attributes of the same subject, as systems of human philosophy
have made them, but as different endowments&mdash;the one of
nature, the other of grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold the new and
surprising union which God alone could teach and alone
accomplish, and which is only an image and an effect of the
ineffable union of two natures in the one person of the
God-man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these latter sentences&mdash;which we have been obliged,
for the sake of brevity, to compress&mdash;we have the suggestion
of Pascal&rsquo;s philosophy both of human nature and <!-- page
186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>of
Divine revelation.&nbsp; He recurs over and over again to the
same idea, that man is great and yet weak, full of capacity and
yet miserable, and that the Gospel alone holds the key to this
enigma of human nature.&nbsp; This, more than any other, is the
pervading thought round which all the others gather.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This twofoldness
(<i>duplicit&eacute;</i>),&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is so visible,
that some have conceived that man must have two souls&mdash;a
simple subject appearing to them incapable of such and so sudden
variations; an immeasurable presumption on the one hand, a
horrible abasement on the other.&nbsp; In spite of all the
miseries which cleave to us, and hold us, as it were, by the
throat (<i>nous tiennent &agrave; la gorge</i>), there is within
us an irrepressible instinct which exalts us.&nbsp; The greatness
of man is so visible that it may be deduced from his very
misery.&nbsp; His very miseries prove his greatness.&nbsp; They
are the miseries of a great lord, of a dethroned sovereign.&nbsp;
The greatness of man consists in his knowledge of his
misery.&nbsp; A tree does not know itself to be miserable. . .
.&nbsp; He is miserable&mdash;the fact is beyond question; but he
is great in knowing it.&rdquo; <a name="citation186"></a><a
href="#footnote186" class="citation">[186]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, reverting to the very same line of thought, as in the
conversation with De Saci&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Philosophers have propounded sentiments not
at all adapted to the twofold condition of man.&nbsp; They have
sought to inspire emotions of pure greatness; but this is not
man&rsquo;s condition.&nbsp; They have sought on the other hand
to inspire sentiments of mere baseness; but neither is this
man&rsquo;s condition.&nbsp; Man needs abasement, not of nature,
however, but of penitence; not that he remain degraded, but that
he may rise to greatness.&nbsp; He needs to feel within him the
emotion of greatness,&mdash;not of merit, however, but of grace.
. . .&nbsp; Two sects have sprung out of this conflict between
reason and sense in man.&nbsp; The one, in renouncing passion,
has aspired to <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>divinity; the other, in renouncing
reason, has sunk to mere brutality. . . .&nbsp; The principles of
the respective philosophies are so far true&mdash;Pyrrhonism,
Stoicism, Atheism even.&nbsp; But the conclusions are false,
because the opposite principles are equally true. . . .&nbsp; We
labour under an incapacity of demonstrating all things invincible
to Dogmatism.&nbsp; We have an innate idea of truth invincible to
all Pyrrhonism. . . .&nbsp; Nature confounds the Pyrrhonist, and
reason the Dogmatist;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or, as the passage was originally written,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We cannot be Pyrrhonists without violating
nature; we cannot be Dogmatists without renouncing nature.&rdquo;
<a name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These and other passages sufficiently show Pascal&rsquo;s
relation to philosophy, and to Pyrrhonism in particular.&nbsp; He
is no enemy of philosophy, but he certainly does not believe it
capable of explaining the riddle of human nature.&nbsp; He is so
far from being a Pyrrhonist in the sense of resting on
Pyrrhonism, that he seeks to mount on its shoulders to a higher
truth.&nbsp; Nay, he clearly recognises that man has an inborn
faculty for truth which not all the contradictions of his
experience can belie.&nbsp; We may and must doubt as to many
things; but there are principles lying at the root of human life
which are invincible to all doubt.&nbsp; We can demonstrate many
things; but there are natural realities beyond our power of
demonstration.&nbsp; On the side of sense, all things seem to
fluctuate and waver in uncertainty; on the side of mere intellect
we soon cross the limit of our powers.&nbsp; But Humanity is more
than either sense or intellect.&nbsp; There is, as he believes, a
primitive endowment of spiritual instinct in man, which looks
forth upon <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>a higher world of reality.&nbsp;
Repeatedly, and in various applications, he recurs to these three
radical sides or elements of Humanity; &ldquo;the
sensible&mdash;the intellectual, or the exercise of reason left
to itself&mdash;and the spiritual or divine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pascal
despairs of a philosophy which is either a mere generalisation of
sensible experience, or which aims at demonstrating everything
from a purely rational point of view; but he is so far from
resting in mere intellectual doubt, that he tries to find a
ground for human certitude in a deeper stratum of Humanity than
either sense or what he calls &ldquo;reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neander
and others have vindicated for him a supreme position as a
philosopher on this very account.&nbsp; With them he is not only
no sceptic, but he stands forth among the men who have specially
vindicated the claims of Humanity as endowed with the divine
attributes of &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; and
&ldquo;will&rdquo;&mdash;the men of &ldquo;full mental
healthiness&rdquo; who have recognised in man a free spiritual
life no less than a life of sense and intellect.&nbsp; This may
or may not be.&nbsp; But the mere fact that Pascal has aimed at a
deeper ground of certitude, whether he has made it clear or not,
and whether or not he has spoken with undue depreciation of other
sources of knowledge, should be enough to vindicate him from the
charge of even philosophical scepticism.&nbsp; In the following
passage he has explained his views more fully.&nbsp; More than
any other, perhaps, it may be taken as the text of his
philosophy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We discover truth,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;not only by reasoning, but by feeling (<i>le
c&oelig;ur</i>); and it is in this latter manner that we discover
first principles&mdash;and in vain does reasoning, which has no
share in their production, try to combat these principles.&nbsp;
The Pyrrhonists, who attempt this, labour in vain.&nbsp; <!--
page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>We know that we are not deceived, however incapable we
may be of proving so by any power of reasoning.&nbsp; This
incapacity only demonstrates the weakness of our reasoning
faculty, and not the incertitude of all our knowledge, as they
pretend.&nbsp; Nay, our knowledge of first principles, such as
the ideas of <i>space</i>, <i>time</i>, <i>motion</i>,
<i>number</i>, is as certain as any obtained by reasoning.&nbsp;
It is, in fact, upon such conclusions of feeling and instinct
that Reason must ultimately rest and base all its
arguments.&nbsp; We <i>feel</i> that there are three dimensions
in space, and that numbers are infinite; and reason hence
demonstrates that there are no two square numbers the one of
which is double the other.&nbsp; Principles are felt,
propositions deduced, and both with certitude, although in
different ways.&nbsp; And it is as absurd for the
&lsquo;reason&rsquo; to demand of the &lsquo;heart&rsquo; proofs
of its first principles before asserting them, as it would be for
the &lsquo;heart&rsquo; to demand of the &lsquo;reason&rsquo; a
<i>feeling</i> of all propositions that she demonstrates before
accepting them.&nbsp; This weakness, therefore, should only serve
to humble reason in its desire to make itself judge of
everything, but by no means to moderate the certitude of our
conviction, as if reason were alone capable of instructing
us.&rdquo; <a name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189"
class="citation">[189]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There may be something to object to in Pascal&rsquo;s mode of
expression in the above passage.&nbsp; Cousin has made the most
of his confusion of &ldquo;reason&rdquo; and
&ldquo;reasoning&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;la raison&rdquo; and
&ldquo;le raisonnement.&rdquo;&nbsp; The expression &ldquo;le
c&oelig;ur,&rdquo; by which he designates the higher faculty of
intuition, may be inadequate and misleading&mdash;complex and
disturbing in its association.&nbsp; But withal, his attitude in
favour of a ground of certainty in human knowledge is
unmistakable.&nbsp; So far he is not only not with Montaigne, but
he is clearly against him.&nbsp; The rights of nature, as he
says, rise up against the Pyrrhonist.&nbsp; They make themselves
good.&nbsp; And however strongly Pascal may <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>draw the
picture of human weakness, and all the contrarieties which our
nature encloses, he does not mean by this to strike at the roots
of all knowledge, and leave man a prey to helpless doubt.&nbsp;
He means merely to shake the throne of rational security, and to
show that no conclusions of mere philosophy can reach all the
exigencies of man&rsquo;s condition.&nbsp; His analysis of human
nature is the analysis of a moralist, and not of a psychologist
or rational philosopher.&nbsp; He looks at man always as a
spiritual being.&nbsp; It is his spiritual capacity which alone
makes him great, and yet intensifies all the lower contradictions
of his nature.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;thought alone which makes
man&rsquo;s greatness.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man can be conceived
&ldquo;without hands or feet or head, but not without
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The possession of the earth would not add
to my greatness.&nbsp; As to space, the universe encloses and
absorbs me as a mere point, but by thought I embrace it. . .
.&nbsp; Man is but a reed, the feeblest of created
things&mdash;but one possessing thought (<i>un roseau
pensant</i>).&nbsp; It needs not that the universe should arm
itself to crush him.&nbsp; A breath, a drop of water, suffices
for his destruction.&nbsp; But were the whole universe to rise
against him, man is yet greater than the universe, since man
<i>knows</i> that he dies.&nbsp; He knows the universe prevails
against him.&nbsp; The universe knows nothing of its
power.&rdquo; <a name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hardly possible to speak more eloquently of the dignity
of human nature.&nbsp; And if it is the same voice which speaks
in such pathetic or it may be harsh tones of human weakness and
misery, and the disproportions of our natural life, it is the
very consciousness of greatness that inspires the consciousness
of misery.&nbsp; Looking from such a height of human dignity, he
sees all the depths of <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>human
baseness.&nbsp; It is this higher spirit which consecrates Pascal
as a moralist.&nbsp; Has he rebuked the presumptions of humanity?
has he called upon proud reason to humble itself? has he gibed
human philosophy, and even gloried for a moment in the
contradictions of empiricism?&nbsp; It is never that he may laugh
at man, or that he may rest in the mere contemplation of his
follies or extravagances, but because he himself profoundly
realised the height and the depth of his being&mdash;the grandeur
to which he could rise, or to which God could raise him, and the
baseness and miseries to which he could sink.&nbsp; Doubtless, as
with all concentrated and meditative natures, Pascal delights to
dwell on the weaker and gloomier side of humanity.&nbsp; This was
partly the result of his Jansenist leanings, but mainly it came
from his own intense reality of feeling.&nbsp; It was bred of his
austere sadness of heart, and is found to run as a note of
profound constitutional melancholy through all his letters, and
all his life, as well as his Thoughts.&nbsp; In the view of
eternity, and of the awful issues involved in religion, the
common life and pursuits of man seemed to him not only frivolous,
but criminal.&nbsp; He looked forth, therefore, on this common
life with eyes not only of tears, but of displeasure.&nbsp; He
seemed even at times to derive something of stern satisfaction
from its very follies and absurdities.&nbsp; But this is only the
temporary mood of the profound moralist touched to his heart by
pangs that he cannot resist.&nbsp; His true view of life is never
cynical,&mdash;but always grave, if bitter&mdash;and hopeful, if
stern.</p>
<p>Pascal&rsquo;s supposed philosophical scepticism admits of
something of the same explanation.&nbsp; He has not only no wish
to disturb the fundamental verities of human <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>thought,
but he endeavours to fix them in an ineradicable instinct or
universal &ldquo;sense,&rdquo; against which all the assaults of
Pyrrhonism must break.&nbsp; But the while he is himself deeply
moved by the perplexities of human reason.&nbsp; Although no
Pyrrhonist in thought, he knows too well in experience the depths
of Pyrrhonism.&nbsp; His mind is one of those to be met with in
all ages, which, while it clings to faith, and is even strong in
the assertion of faith&rsquo;s claims, is yet in certain moments
utterly distracted by doubt.&nbsp; Constantly searching the
foundations of human knowledge,&mdash;sifting them as with
lighted glance,&mdash;they seemed to him at times to crumble away
before him.&nbsp; Nothing remained fixed to his piercing
look.&nbsp; As few minds have experienced, he felt the awful
darkness which encloses all mortal aspiration, and the keenest
audacities of human speculation.&nbsp; The incapacities of human
reason at such times overwhelmed him, and left him hopeless, or,
still worse, in a half-derisive mood.&nbsp; And these moods, as
well as his clearer and more elaborate thoughts, hastily
transferred to paper, are found amongst his notes.&nbsp; It is
quite impossible to vindicate his consistency, and it is not in
the least necessary to do this, as already explained; while we
feel bound to maintain that his higher mood is his true mood, and
that the Pascal of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo;&mdash;the
veritable Pascal&mdash;is to be judged, not by his weakness but
by his strength; by his moments of clear mental sanity and
insight, and not by his moments of despair or of derisive mockery
of all human philosophy.</p>
<p>This seems to us the true light in which to regard the famous
wager-essay on the existence of God, which has been a scandal
even to some of his greatest admirers.&nbsp; It <!-- page
193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>is
impossible to defend this essay on any principle of sound
philosophy.&nbsp; Either there is a God or there is not.&nbsp;
Which side of the question shall we take?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Reason,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;cannot decide.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The fact, he means, cannot be demonstrated according to his
customary use of the word reason.&nbsp; But if it cannot, there
must yet be a balance of reason, and proof on one side or the
other.&nbsp; And the only fair and manly issue of such a question
must be, On which side lies this balance?&nbsp; A valid theistic
conclusion can be found in no other way, and least of all in any
calculation of chances, or balance of self-interest.&nbsp; And
yet it is this last which Pascal has put forward with such
prominence in this famous essay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wager,&rdquo; he
says.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you win, you win everything; if you lose,
you lose nothing.&nbsp; Wager, then, without hesitation, that God
exists. . . .&nbsp; On one side is an eternity of life, of
infinite blessedness to be gained, and what you stake is finite.
. . .&nbsp; Our proposition is, that the finite is to be vested
in a wager, in which there is an equal chance of gain and loss,
and <i>infinitude to gain</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The play was hardly
worthy of Pascal, and the &lsquo;mystery of the game&rsquo; could
certainly never be unravelled in any such way.&nbsp; But not a
few minds like Pascal&rsquo;s&mdash;with deep spiritual
intuitions and yet a craving for scientific certainty constantly
mocking these intuitions&mdash;have felt in a similar manner the
hazard of the great question, and may have said to themselves,
&ldquo;We must take our stand, and this is the side which weighs
in the balance.&nbsp; We can lose nothing; we may gain
everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mood is not a lofty one, and it is
no higher in Pascal than in any one else; but there are moments
of terrible doubt, when the soul is so borne away on the surge of
the sceptical <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>wave that rises from the depth of
all human speculation, that it can only cling to the Divine by an
effort of will, and with something of the gamester&rsquo;s
thought that this is the winning side!&nbsp; The thought may be
shallow and poor in itself, but in such cases it comes not out of
the shallows but out of the depths of a mind torn by distracting
doubts in the face of the dreadful problems of life.</p>
<p>Out of the same depth of spiritual experience and trenchant
moral analysis comes all that is true and valuable in his
so-called &lsquo;Apology.&rsquo;&nbsp; That the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo; were more or less designed to form
such an Apology&mdash;to be woven into the plan of a treatise in
defence of the Christian religion&mdash;seems beyond doubt.&nbsp;
He had himself, according to the statement of his nephew,
unfolded such a plan to his friends, in a lengthened conversation
about the year 1657 or 1659.&nbsp; They were charmed with the
loftiness of his design, and listened to his exposition of it for
two or three hours with unabated interest.&nbsp; He was to
commence with an analysis of human nature, and to advance from
the contemplation of its mysteries, obscurities, and
perplexities, to the consideration of the various methods,
philosophical and religious, by which reason had endeavoured to
meet the difficulties of thought and life.&nbsp; After explaining
the inconclusiveness and absurdities of these
methods&mdash;represented by the diverse philosophies and
religions of the world&mdash;he was to call attention to the
Jewish religion, and the superiority which it presents to all
others, both in the extraordinary circumstances of its history,
and in the revelation which it gives of one God, Creator and
Governor of the world, and of the origin of man&mdash;his
primitive innocence and fall.&nbsp; The idea of the fall, which
was a central one in all <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Pascal&rsquo;s thoughts, was to be fully expounded, in
its own character and as &ldquo;the source not only of whatever
is most inexplicable in man&rsquo;s nature, but also of a
multitude of things, external to him, of which he knows not the
causes.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the fall he was to pass to the hopes of
deliverance revealed in the Old Testament, and especially the
lofty conception which it gives of God as a God of love, a
feature peculiar to it, and &ldquo;which he deemed the essence of
true religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From such general considerations&mdash;of the nature of
prolegomena or &ldquo;preparation&rdquo; for the reader&rsquo;s
mind&mdash;he proceeded to furnish a brief view of &ldquo;the
positive proofs of the truths he wanted to
establish,&mdash;proofs derived from the authenticity of the
books of Moses, especially the miracles they record, the figures
and types they embody.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then went on more at
length to prove the truth of religion from prophecy, which he is
represented as having studied deeply, and certain views of which,
&ldquo;of a nature wholly original,&rdquo; he explained with
great clearness.&nbsp; Finally, &ldquo;after going through the
books of the Old Testament,&rdquo; he advanced to those of the
New, &ldquo;and deduced from them his crowning proofs of the
truths of the Gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He began with Christ, whose
divine mission he already supposed to be established by the
argument from prophecy, and added additional force of evidence
from His resurrection, His miracles, His doctrines, and the tenor
of His life; then from the character and mission of the apostles;
and lastly, from the style and manner of the New Testament books,
and especially of the Gospels, &ldquo;the multitude of miracles,
martyrs, and the saints,&rdquo;&mdash;in a word, from all
&ldquo;by which the Christian religion is so triumphantly
established.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>It is needless to say how imperfectly this design was
ever accomplished; and no ingenuity of restoration can make of
Pascal&rsquo;s apologetic plan anything but a mass of imperfect
fragments.&nbsp; Yet he has left us a definite series of Thoughts
on the Jewish religion, on Miracles, Figures, and Prophecy, and
also on Jesus Christ and the general character of the Christian
religion.&nbsp; In these Thoughts, it must be admitted, there is
but little to reward our study in comparison with those of a more
introductory and philosophical nature.&nbsp; Pascal&rsquo;s
genius was in no degree historical, and but slightly
critical&mdash;not to mention that the very idea of historical
criticism had not emerged in his time, nor long afterwards.&nbsp;
While realising so profoundly the perplexities of human
experience, he has no conception of the difficulties that beset
historical tradition; nor do his habits of scientific
investigation, and the natural severity and logical rigour of his
mind, seem to have suggested to him any misgivings as to the
prevalence of miraculous agency in the world.&nbsp; The perfect
faith with which he accepted the &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; of the
Holy Thorn is a sufficient indication of his state of mind in
this respect, and how ready he was to accept evidence the very
idea of which merely excites a smile of wonder in the modern
mind.</p>
<p>It cannot be said, therefore, to be any matter of regret that
Pascal did not live to complete the historical portion of his
projected work,&mdash;what he seems himself, from the report of
his friends, to have considered the main structure of the defence
he intended to rear on behalf of the religion so dear to
him.&nbsp; He expended his real strength on the portico to the
designed temple.&nbsp; His genius fitted <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>him to deal
with this, and with this alone, in any adequate manner.&nbsp; His
moral analysis, at once keen and veracious, enabled him not only
to lay bare all the &ldquo;disproportions&rdquo; of humanity,
but, moreover, to unfold the adaptation of Christianity as a
spiritual system to meet and remedy these disproportions.&nbsp;
This is the real &ldquo;apologetic&rdquo; work of the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; and the only one for which
Pascal&rsquo;s mind pre-eminently fitted him.&nbsp; He sees in
the Gospel a Divine Power which is capable of ministering to
man&rsquo;s higher wants&mdash;a power of infinite compassion
towards human weakness and misery, of infinite help for the one
and remedy for the other.&nbsp; The Christian religion, according
to him, alone &ldquo;understands at once man&rsquo;s greatness
and degradation, and the reason of both the one and the
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is equally important for man to
know his capacity of being like God and his unworthiness of
Him.&nbsp; To know of God without knowing his misery, or to know
his misery without knowing the Redeemer, who alone can deliver
him from it, is alike dangerous.&nbsp; The one knowledge
constitutes the pride of the philosopher, the other the despair
of the atheist.&nbsp; Man must therefore have the double
experience, and so it has pleased God to reveal it.&nbsp; This
the Christian religion does; in this it consists.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again: &ldquo;Christ is the centre in which alone we find at once
God and our misery.&nbsp; In Him alone we have a God whom we must
approach without pride, and before whom we may yet bow without
despair.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another and more lengthened passage he
brings the two ideas of human corruption and divine redemption
closely together, the one as supplementary of the other, and
expressly <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>emphasises the perfection with which
Christianity fits so to speak, into all the wards of the human
enigma,&mdash;in comparison with every system of human
philosophy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Without divine knowledge,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;what have men been able to do save to exalt themselves in
the consciousness of their original greatness, or abase
themselves in the view of their present weakness?&nbsp; Unable to
see the whole truth, they have never attained to perfect
virtue.&nbsp; One class considering nature as incorrupt, another
as irreparable, they have been alternately the victims of pride
or sensuality&mdash;the two sources of all vice. . . .&nbsp; If,
in one case, they recognised man&rsquo;s excellence, they ignored
his corruption; and so, in escaping indulgence, they lost
themselves in pride.&nbsp; In the other case, in acknowledging
his weakness they ignored his dignity, and, while escaping
vanity, plunged into despair.&nbsp; Hence the diverse sects of
Stoics and Epicureans, of Dogmatists and Academicians, etc.&nbsp;
The Christian religion alone can reconcile these discrepancies
and cure both evils, not by expelling the one by the other,
according to the wisdom of this world, but by expelling both the
one and the other by the simplicity of the Gospel.&nbsp; For it
teaches the just that while it elevates them even to be partakers
of the divine nature, they still carry with them in this lofty
state the source of all their corruption, making them during life
subjects of error, misery, death, and sin.&nbsp; At the same
time, it proclaims to the most impious that they are capable of
becoming partakers of a Redeemer&rsquo;s grace.&nbsp; By thus
warning those whom it justifies, and consoling those whom it
condemns, it tempers with just measure fear and hope, through the
twofold capacity in all of grace and sin; so that it abases
infinitely more than reason, yet without producing despair, and
exalts infinitely more than natural pride, yet without puffing
up,&mdash;plainly showing that it alone is exempt from all error
and wrong, and possesses the power at once of instructing and
correcting men.&nbsp; Who, then, can withhold his belief in this
revelation, or refuse to adore its celestial light?&nbsp; For is
<!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>it not more clear than day that we feel in ourselves
the ineffaceable traces of divine excellence?&nbsp; And it is
equally clear that we experience every hour the effects of our
fall and ruin.&nbsp; What, then, comes to us from all this chaos
and wild confusion, in a voice of irresistible conviction, but
the irrefragable truth of both those sides of humanity?&rdquo; <a
name="citation199"></a><a href="#footnote199"
class="citation">[199]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage conveys very clearly at once the gist of
Pascal&rsquo;s philosophy and the chief merit of his line of
Christian apology.&nbsp; The two cannot be separated.&nbsp; They
run constantly into one another.&nbsp; He was a Christian
apologist in so far as he was a Christian philosopher; and those
who reject his line of Christian defence, will also reject his
whole mode of thought.&nbsp; To him the only solution of human
perplexity in thought and life is Christ.&nbsp; He is the
&ldquo;object and centre of all things, in whom alone all
contradictions are reconciled.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the
conclusion of his intelligence, and not of his despair.&nbsp;
Whatever may be the traces of scepticism in his intellectual
nature, it is doing him great injustice to represent his
acceptance of Christianity as a mere refuge from
uncertainty.&nbsp; He is a totally different man from Huet, with
whom Cousin has ventured to compare him in this respect.&nbsp; He
never dallies on the surface; mere traditionalism has but a
slight hold of him.&nbsp; He is a Christian not because he has
been taught Christianity, or because the Church as a divine
institution claims his allegiance.&nbsp; All these influences may
have affected him, and given a turn to his mind; but they do not
touch the essence of his thoughts.&nbsp; Anything he does say of
the external claims of Christianity has but little weight.&nbsp;
It is out of the depths of his own spiritual experience that his
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>faith is born.&nbsp; It is a voice within him, a
conflicting cry of weakness and aspiration going up everywhere
from humanity, that find their answer in Christ.&nbsp; There is
the enigma of man on the one side, to him otherwise hopeless, and
Christ on the other, holding the keys of the enigma in His
hand.&nbsp; The solution appeared to him perfect, according to
his study and analysis of the problem&mdash;the twofoldness that
he found in man, of divine dignity on the one hand, and
frivolous, sensual degradation on the other.&nbsp; Both facts, he
says, are equally clear and certain.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s fall from
a state of divine innocence alone explains them; and the Gospel
alone recognises the one side as well as the other of human
nature, and provides a Power capable of restoring its true
balance and rectifying all its disorder.&nbsp; He felt in himself
the might of this power healing all the wounds of his own heart,
and binding up the shreds of his Christian efforts &ldquo;to do
justly, and love mercy, and walk humbly with God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whether we agree with all his analyses, or recognise all the
adaptations which he describes, it is impossible not to feel that
they were living to him, and that he saw in Christianity not
merely a refuge for the disappointed heart, but a true philosophy
of life&mdash;the only &ldquo;sure and sound philosophy,&rdquo;
as Justin Martyr had found long before him.</p>
<p>It is in the same spirit that he writes in many of his later
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some of the passages already
quoted are in fact taken from the chapter &ldquo;On the Christian
Religion,&rdquo; which appears to have been intended to form one
of the concluding chapters of his Apology.&nbsp; But he repeats
over and over again the same strain&mdash;that the present
condition of man is only intelligible in the light <!-- page
201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>of
the Christian revelation, and that this revelation alone answers
to all man&rsquo;s necessities.&nbsp; Christ has not only
proclaimed a higher truth to man, which man is bound to accept
under penalties of default.&nbsp; This tone is also found
sometimes, but comparatively seldom.&nbsp; The prevailing note
is, that there is an admirable fitness between the two&mdash;the
mysteries of human nature witnessing to the divine veracity of
the Gospel, and the Gospel again holding the only key to these
mysteries, and the only power of unravelling them and restoring
them to their divine original.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesus Christ,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;is for all men; Moses for one
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The knowledge of God without a
knowledge of our misery produces pride; that of our misery
without God leads to despair.&nbsp; The knowledge of Jesus is the
means by which we at once find God and our misery.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Without Jesus Christ man is sunk in vice and misery. . .
.&nbsp; In Him is all our virtue and felicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the more directly apologetic &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es&rsquo;
of Pascal there are many of great significance and interest,
slight as may be the value of his general historical argument, so
far as this can be traced.&nbsp; Wherever he trusts to his own
clear judgment and profound penetration, he throws out sentences
weighty with meaning, and capable of being expanded into trains
of argument.&nbsp; Our shortening space warns us that our
quotations must come to an end; but the reader may thank us for
drawing his attention to the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Even when Epictetus had discovered the
right way, he could only say to man, &lsquo;You follow a wrong
one.&rsquo;&nbsp; He shows that there is another, but he does not
lead to it. . . .&nbsp; Jesus Christ alone leads to
it&mdash;<i>via</i>, <i>veritas</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>&ldquo;Jesus Christ has spoken great things so simply
that they seem to have cost Him little thought&mdash;and yet so
fitly that we see well what His thought was.&rdquo;&nbsp; [This
combination of clearness and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> is
admirable.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;The apostles were either deceived or deceivers; either
supposition is full of difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What right have they to say, &lsquo;It is impossible
that we should rise again&rsquo;?&nbsp; Which is the more
difficult to be&mdash;to be born, or to be raised from the
dead?&nbsp; Is it less difficult to come into being than to
return to being?&nbsp; Custom (experience) renders the one easy
to us; the want of custom makes the other seem impossible.&nbsp;
But <i>this is a popular way of judging</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who taught the evangelists the qualities of a truly
heroic soul, that they should paint it to such perfection in
Jesus Christ?&nbsp; Why have they made Him weak in His
agony?&nbsp; Did they not know how to describe a death of
fortitude?&nbsp; Assuredly; for it is the same St Luke paints St
Stephen&rsquo;s death as so much braver than that of Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; They have made Him capable of fear before the
necessity of death had come, then entirely calm and brave.&nbsp;
But when they show Him in trouble, the trouble comes from
Himself; in the face of men He remains unmoved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The highest achievement of reason is to recognise that
there is an infinity of things which surpass its powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we submit everything to reason, our religion would
have nothing mysterious or supernatural.&nbsp; If we violate the
principles of reason, our religion will be absurd and
ridiculous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two extremes&mdash;to exclude reason, and to
admit only reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your own consent, and the steady voice of your
own reason, and not that of others, which must make you
believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If antiquity was the rule of faith, the ancients were
without a rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them say what they will, it must be confessed that
the Christian religion is something astonishing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is because you were born in it,&rsquo; they
say.&nbsp; So far from this, I <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>am on my
guard against it on this very account, lest this incline me
unduly to it.&nbsp; But though I was born in it, the facts are
not the less as I find them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True to his whole conception of religion as the free choice of
the heart and will, Pascal does not find any special difficulty
in the fact of so many rejecting Christianity.&nbsp; It is of its
very nature that it cannot be forced on any mind.&nbsp; The God
of the Gospel can only be reached by faith.&nbsp; To all without
faith, or the inner eye to see Him, He is a <i>Deus
absconditus</i>, &ldquo;a God who hides himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
one of his letters to Mademoiselle de Roannez, he dwells upon
this idea, which also continually recurs in his
Thoughts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If God continually revealed Himself to man,
faith would have no value; we could not help believing.&nbsp; If
He did not reveal Himself, there could be no such thing as
faith.&nbsp; While hiding Himself, He yet reveals Himself to
those who are willing to be His servants. . . .&nbsp; All things
hide a mystery.&nbsp; All are a veil which conceal God.&nbsp; The
Christian must recognise Him in all. . . .&nbsp; There is light
enough for those who wish to see, but darkness enough for those
who are of an opposite disposition. . . .&nbsp; For God would
rather move the will than the intellect.&nbsp; Perfect clearness
would cure the one, but injure the other.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so this great mind comes round once more to its central
thought, that religion is born not of science, but of love and
faith.&nbsp; Christianity appeared to Pascal divine&mdash;as the
only true interpreter of human experience; and where this
experience bore no witness to it, and found no blessing in it,
the fault and the misery were its own.&nbsp; The divine light was
not gone because men did not see it, when they were not willing
to see it.&nbsp; <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>This may seem a hard saying,&mdash;a
paradox of faith rejoicing in its own illumination, rather than
an utterance of reason challenging the world.&nbsp; But can a
divine appeal ever go further?&nbsp; Christian apology has its
own sphere, no less than science; and the evidence which the one
desiderates is not the supreme life and power of the other.&nbsp;
It may not on this account be the less satisfactory or the less
rational when the whole life of humanity is looked at.</p>
<p>If we ask ourselves, in conclusion, what is the chief charm of
the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; we feel inclined to
answer,&mdash;their touching reality.&nbsp; They are the
utterances of one who thought not only deeply but
passionately.&nbsp; A strange thrill of personal emotion runs
through them all, animating them with vitality, even when
one-sided or extravagant.&nbsp; One of his own countrymen <a
name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204"
class="citation">[204]</a> has said of Pascal that it was his
mission to do for theology what Socrates did for
philosophy&mdash;to bring it down from heaven to earth.&nbsp; And
certainly there is the breathing movement as of a human heart
through his whole writings.&nbsp; More than anything else, it is
this vitality combined with his exquisite literary art which sets
him above all his friends and contemporaries&mdash;Arnauld, De
Saci, Le Maitre, Nicole, or Fontaine.&nbsp; Still, when we read
the &lsquo;Provincial Letters&rsquo; or the
&lsquo;Pens&eacute;es,&rsquo; we feel ourselves in communion with
a living writer who knew how to light up with an immortal touch
both the follies of ecclesiasticism and the struggles of a
solitary spirit after truth.&nbsp; The tenderness of a genuine
insight mingles with all the sublimity <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>and severe
reserve of the thought, and so we get close to a true soul,
distant as Pascal himself in some respects remains to us.&nbsp;
The play of human feeling which we miss in the man moves in his
writings, and touches our hearts with an ineffable sympathy, even
when we remain unconvinced or unenlightened.</p>

Pascal is probably that prefixed by M. Faug&egrave;re to his
edition of the &lsquo;Pens&eacute;es.&rsquo;&nbsp; The sketch, in
red chalk, was found amongst the papers of M. Domat, an eminent
advocate, and one of Pascal&rsquo;s well-known friends.&nbsp; It
bears below an inscription by Domat&rsquo;s

were eighteen Letters in all published by Pascal, but there is a

&ldquo;read twice through,&rdquo; was the great repository from
which he gathered the details of Jesuit doctrine which he exposes
with such minuteness.&nbsp; Escobar, like so many of the chief
Jesuit writers, was a Spaniard, born at Valladolid in 1589.&nbsp;

Fontaine&rsquo;s Memoirs, quoted by Cousin (B. Pascal, p. 132),
gives an interesting and lively glimpse of the philosophical
discourses at Port Royal.&nbsp; It may not be without some
application to the modern no less than the original Cartesian
doctrine.&nbsp; &ldquo;How many little agitations raised
themselves in this desert touching the human science of
philosophy and the new opinions of M. Descartes!&nbsp; As M.
Arnauld in his hours of relaxation conversed on these subjects
with his more intimate friends, the excitement spread on every
side, and the solitude, in the hours of social intercourse,
resounded with these discussions.&nbsp; There was hardly a
solitary who did not talk of &lsquo;automata.&rsquo;&nbsp; To
beat a dog was no longer a matter of any moment.&nbsp; The stick
was laid on with the utmost indifference, and a great fool was
made of those who pitied the animals, <i>as if they had any
feeling</i>.&nbsp; They said they were only clockwork, and that
the cries they uttered when they were beaten were no more than
the noise of some little spring that had been moved, and that all
this involved no sensation.&nbsp; They nailed the poor animals
upon boards by the fore-paws, in order to dissect them while
still alive, and to see the circulation of the blood, which was a
great subject of discussion.&nbsp; The chateau of the Duc de
Luynes was the source of all these curious inquiries, and a
source that was inexhaustible.&nbsp; There they talked
incessantly, and with admiration, of the new system of the world
according to M. Descartes.&rdquo;</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
